the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science
and science-based tools for everyday life. [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm Andrew Huberman,
and I'm a Professor of Neurobiology
and Ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is
Dr. Lex Fridman Dr. Lex Fridman is an expert
in electrical and computer engineering, artificial
intelligence, and robotics. He is also the host of the
Lex Fridman Podcast, which initially started
as a podcast focus on technology and
science of various kinds, including computer
science and physics, but rapidly evolved to include
guests and other topics as a matter of focus,
including sport. For instance, Dr. Lex
Freedman is a Black Belt in Brazilian jujitsu. And he's had numerous
guests on who come from the fields
of Brazilian jujitsu, both from the coaching side
and from the competitor side. He also has shown
an active interest in topics such as chess
and essentially anything that involves intense activation
and engagement of the mind and/or body. In fact, the Lex
Fridman podcast has evolved to take on
very difficult topics such as mental health-- he's
had various psychiatrists and other guests on that
relate to mental health and mental illness, as well as
guest focused on geopolitics and some of the more
controversial issues that face our times. He's had comedians, he's had
scientists, he's had friends, he's had enemies on his podcast. Lex has a phenomenal, I would
say a 1 in an eight billion ability to find these people,
make them comfortable, and in that comfort, both
try to understand them and to confront them and to
push them so that we all learn. All of which is to say that
Lex Fridman is no longer just an accomplished scientist,
he certainly is that. But he has also become one of
the more preeminent thought leaders on the planet. And if there's anything
that really captures the essence of Lex
Fridman, it's his love of learning, his desire to share
with us, the human experience, and to broaden that experience
so that we all may benefit. In many ways, our discussion
during today's episode captures the many
facets of Lex Fridman, although no conversation, of
course, could capture them all. We sit down to the
conversation just days after Lex returned from
Ukraine, where he deliberately placed himself into the
tension of that environment in order to understand the
geopolitics of the region and to understand
exactly what was happening at the level of the
ground and the people there. You may notice that he carries
quite a lot of both, emotion and knowledge and understanding. And yet in a very
classic Lex Fridman way, you'll notice that
he's able to zoom out of his own experience around
any number of different topics and view them through
a variety of lenses so that first of all, everyone
feel included, but most of all, so that everyone learned
something new, that is to gain new perspective. Our discussion also ventures
into the waters of social media and how that
landscape is changing the way that science and
technology are communicated. We also get into the topics of
motivation drive and purpose, both finding it and executing
on that drive and purpose. I should mention that this is
episode 100 of the Huberman Lab Podcast. And I would be remiss
if I did not tell you that there would be no
Huberman Lab Podcast, were it not for Lex Fridman. I was a fan of the
Lex Fridman Podcast long before I was ever invited
on to the podcast as a guest. And after our first
recording, Lex was the one that suggested
that I start a podcast. He only gave me two
pieces of advice. The first piece of advice
was, start a podcast. And the second
piece of advice was that I not just make it me
blabbing into the microphone and staring at the camera. So I can safely say
that I at least followed half of his advice, and that
I am ever grateful for Lex, both as a friend, a
colleague in science, and now fellow podcaster for
making the suggestion that we start this podcast. I already mentioned
a few of the topics covered on today's podcast. But I can assure you that
there is far more to the person that many of us
know as Lex Fridman. If you are somebody interested
in artificial intelligence, engineering, or robotics,
today's discussion is most certainly for you. And if you are not,
but you are somebody who is interested in world
politics, and more importantly, the human experience,
both the individual and the collective
human experience, Lex shares what can
only be described as incredible insights
into what he views as the human experience and what
is optimal in order to derive from our time on this planet. Before we begin, I'd
like to emphasize that this podcast is separate
from my teaching and research roles at Stanford. It is however, part of
my desire and effort to bring zero cost to
consumer information about science and
science-related tools to the general public. In keeping with
that theme, I'd like to thank the sponsors
of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is LMNT. LMNT is an electrolyte drink
with everything you need and nothing you don't. That means the electrolytes,
sodium, potassium, and magnesium are in LMNT
in the correct ratios. But it has no sugar. As I mentioned before
on the podcast, electrolytes are
critical to the function of every cell in the
body, and especially the cells in your brain,
meaning neurons or nerve cells. Indeed, the ability
for nerve cells to be active and communicate
with one another critically depends on sodium,
potassium, and magnesium. You can get electrolytes
from a variety of sources. But it's often hard to get
them in the proper ratios, even from food. So if you're somebody who's
exercising a lot and sweating, or if you're somebody
following, for instance, a low carbohydrate or even a
semi-low carbohydrate diet, that will cause you to
excrete electrolytes. I tend to have my
LMNT first thing in the morning when I wake up
or within the first few hours of waking, any time while
or after I'm exercising, or I've sweat a lot, such
as exiting the sauna. If you'd like to try LMNT
you can go to drinkLMNT-- that's LMNT..com/Huberman to
claim a free element sample pack with your purchase. Again, that's drinkLMNT,
LMNT.com/Huberman to my free sample pack. Today's episode is also
brought to us by Levels. Levels is a program
that lets you see how different foods affect
your health by giving you real-time feedback on your
diet using a continuous glucose monitor. Now blood glucose or blood
sugar is a critical aspect of your immediate
and long term health, and indeed, your
feelings of vigor and mental clarity and
well-being at any moment. One of the key things is to know
how different foods and food combinations and
timing of food intake is impacting blood glucose. And with Levels,
you're able to assess all of that in real time. I tried Levels. And what it taught
me, for instance, was that I can eat certain
foods at certain times of day. But if I eat them at
other times a day, I get a blood sugar crash. It also taught me,
for instance, how to space my exercise
and my food intake. It turns out for me, exercising
fasted is far more beneficial. That's something I
learned using Levels. And it's completely
transformed, not just the spacing and timing
of my diet and exercise, but also use of things like
the sauna and other activities. It's been a tremendous
learning for me that's really shaped an enormous
number of factors in my life that have led to me feeling
far more vigorous with far more mental focus and physical
strength and endurance. So if you're interested in
learning more about Levels and trying a continuous
glucose monitor yourself, go to levels.link/Huberman. Again that's levels.link,
L-I-N-K/Huberman. Today's episode is also
brought to us by Eight Sleep. Eight Sleep make smart mattress
covers with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity. I've talked many
times on this podcast about the critical relationship
between sleep and body temperature. That is in order to fall
asleep and stay deeply asleep throughout the night,
our body temperature needs to drop by
about 1 to 3 degrees. And conversely when we
wake up in the morning, that is in large part,
because of our body heating up by 1 to 3 degrees. Now people have different
core body temperatures. And they tend to run colder or
hotter throughout the night. Eight Sleep allows you
to adjust the temperature of your sleeping
environment so that you have the optimal temperature
that gets you the best night's sleep. I started sleeping on
an Eight Sleep mattress cover about eight months ago. And it has completely
transformed my sleep. I sleep so much deeper,
I wake up far less during the middle of
the night, if at all, and I wake up feeling far
better than I ever have, even after the same
amount of sleep. If you want to try
Eight Sleep, you can go to eightsleep.com/Huberman to

Dr. Lex Fridman, welcome back. LEX FRIDMAN: It's good
to be back in a bedroom. This feels like a porn set. I apologize to open that way. I've never been in a porn
set, so I should admit this. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Our
studio has being renovated. So here we are for the
monumental recording of episode 100-- LEX FRIDMAN: Episode
100 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, which was inspired
by the Lex Fridman Podcast. Some people already
know the story. But I'll repeat it again
for those that don't. There would not be a
Huberman Lab Podcast, were it not for Lex Fridman. Because after recording
as a guest on his podcast a few years ago, he
made the suggestion that I start a podcast. And he explained
to me how it works. And he said, ""You
should start a podcast. But just make sure
that it's not you blabbing the whole
time, Andrew."" And I only sort of
followed the advice. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
well, you surprised me, surprised the world, that
you're able to talk for hours and cite some of the
best science going on and be able to
give people advice without many interruptions
or edits or any of that. I mean, that takes an
incredible amount of skill that you're probably born with. And some of it is developed. I mean, the whole science
community is proud of you, man. Stanford is proud of you. So yeah, it's a beautiful thing. It was really surprising. Because it's unclear
how a scientist can do a great podcast
that's not just shooting the shit
about random stuff, but really is giving very
structured, good advice that's boiling down the
state of the art science into something that's
actually useful for people. So that was impressive. It's like holy shit, he
actually pulled this off. And doing it every week
on a different topic-- I mean, I'm usually
positive, especially for people I love and support. But damn, I thought,
there's no way he's going to be able to pull
this off week after week. And it's been only getting
better and better and better. Had a whole rant on a recent
podcast, I forget with who, of how awesome you are
with Rana el Kaliouby. She's a emotion recognition
person, AI person. And then she didn't
know who you were. And I was like, what
the hell do you mean? And I just went on this whole
rant of how awesome you are. Is hilarious. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'm
very gratified to hear this. I'm-- it's a little
uncomfortable for me to hear but listen, I'm just really
happy if people are getting information that they like
and can make actionable. And it was inspired by you. And look right back at you. I've followed a number of
your structural formats. Attire, I don't wear a tie. I'm constantly reminded
about this by my father. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Who says
what-- he'd saw my podcast. And he was like, why
don't you dress properly like your friend Lex? He literally said that. And it's a debate that
goes back and forth. But nonetheless-- LEX FRIDMAN: How does it feel? Episode 100. How does it feel? ANDREW HUBERMAN:
You know, I think. LEX FRIDMAN: Can you
imagine you're here? You hear after so many
episodes and done so much. I mean, the number of
hours is just insane. The amount of
passion, the amount of work you put into
this, what's it feel like? ANDREW HUBERMAN: It feels great. And it feels very much
like the horizon is still at the same distance
in front of me. Every episode, I just try
and get information there. And the process that we
talked about on your podcast. We won't go into it of
collecting information, distilling it down
to some simple notes, walking around,
listening to music, trying to figure out
what the motifs are, and then-- as just like you,
I don't use a teleprompter or anything like that. There's very minimal notes. So it feels great,
and I love it. And again, I'm just grateful
to you for inspiring it. And I just want to keep
going and do more of it. And I should say
I am also relieved that we're sitting here because
you recently went overseas to a very intense war zone,
literally, the Ukraine. And the entire time
that you were there, I was genuinely concerned. The world's a unpredictable
place, in general. And we don't always get the only
vote and what happens to us. So first of all,
welcome back safely, one peace, one alive peace. And what was that like? I mean, at a broad level,
at a specific level, what drew you there? What surprised you? And how do you think it changed
you in coming back here? LEX FRIDMAN: I think
there's a lot to say. But first, it is
really good to be back. One of the things
that when you go to a difficult part of the world
or a part of the world that's going through
something difficult, you really appreciate how
great it is to be an American. Everything. The easy access to food. Despite what people think, the
stable, reliable rule of law. The lack of corruption in that
you can trust that if you start a business or if you take
on various pursuits in life that there's not going to
be at-scale manipulation of your efforts such
that you can't succeed. So this kind of
capitalism is in it's-- the ideal of capitalism is
really still burning bright in this country. And it really makes you
appreciate those aspects. And also just the ability to
have a home for generations, across generations. So you can have your
grandfather live in Kentucky in a certain city. And then his children lived
there, and you live there, and then it just
continues on and on. That's the kind of thing you can
have when you don't have war. Because war destroys
entire communities. And it destroys
histories, generations, like life stories that stretch
across the generations. So-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah yeah. I didn't even think about
that until you said just now. But photographs, hard drives
get destroyed or just abandoned. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Libraries. I mean, nowadays, things
exist in the cloud but are still a lot of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
--material goods that are irreplaceable, right. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, even in rural
parts of the United States, they don't exist in
the cloud, right. A lot of people still, well,
even in towns, they still love the physical photo
album of your family. A lot of people still
store their photographs of families in the VHS tapes and
all that kind of stuff, yeah. But I think-- there's so many
things I've learned and really felt the lessons. One of which is nobody gives a
damn when your photos are gone and all that kind of
stuff, your house is gone. The thing time and time
again I saw for people that lost everything is how
happy they are for the people. They love the friends, the
family that are still alive. That's the only thing
they talk about. That, in fact, they
don't mention actually with much dramatic sort
of vigor about the trauma of losing your home. They're just non-stop saying
how lucky they are that person X person Y is still here. And that makes you realize
that when you lose everything, it's still-- it makes you realize
what really matters, which is the people
in your life. I mean, a lot of people kind
of realize that later in life, when you're facing mortality,
when you're facing your death, or you get a cancer
diagnosis, that kind of stuff. I think people here in
America, in California, with the fires, you you
can still lose your home. You are going to
realize, like, nah. It doesn't really matter. It's a pain in the ass
but what matters is still the family, the
people, and so on. I think the most intense thing-- I talked to several hundred
people, some of which is recorded. I've really been
struggling to put that out because I have to
edit it myself. And so you're talking about 30,
40 hours of footage, and it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is
emotionally struggling? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
It is extremely difficult. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Are you
like emotional struggle? LEX FRIDMAN: It's
extremely difficult. So I talked to a
lot of politicians. The number two in the
country, number three. I'll be back there to
talk to the president to do a three-hour conversation. Those are easy to edit. They're really heartfelt
and thoughtful folks from different perspectives
on the geopolitics of the war. But the ones that
really hard to edit is like grandmas that are
in the middle of nowhere. They lost everything. They still have hope,
they still have love. And some of them have-- some of them, many of
them, unfortunately, have now hate in their heart. So in February, when
Russia invaded Ukraine, this is the thing I
realized about War. One of the most
painful one lessons is that war creates
generational hate. We sometimes think about war
as a thing that kills people, kills civilians, kills
soldiers, takes away lives, injures people. But we don't
directly think about the secondary and
tertiary effects of that which lasts decades. Which is anyone who's lost
the father or a mother or a daughter or a son,
they now hate not just the individual
soldiers or the leaders that invaded their country but
the entirety of the people. So it's not that they
hate Vladimir Putin or hate the Russian military. They hate Russian people. So that tears the
fabric of a thing that, for me-- my half
my family's from Ukraine, half of my family
is from Russia. But there is-- I remember the pain the
triumph of World War two still resonates through
my entire family tree. And so, you remember when
the Russians and Ukrainians fought together against
this Nazi invasion. You remember a lot of that. And now, to see the fabric
of this peoples torn apart completely with hate is really,
really difficult. For me, just to realize that
things will just never be the same on this particular
cultural, historical aspect. But also, there's so many
painful ways in which things will never be the same. Which is we've seen that
it's possible to have a major hot war in
the 21st century. I think a lot of people
are watching this. China is watching this. India is watching this. United States is watching this
and thinking we can actually have a large-scale war. And I think the lessons
learned from that. Might be the kind that lead
to a major World War III in the 21st century. So one of the things I realized
watching the whole scene is that we don't know
shit about what's going to happen in the 21st century. And it might-- we kind of have
this intuition like surely there's not going
to be another war. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Like
we'll just coast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, pandemic. Yeah-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
And back to normal. LEX FRIDMAN: Back to normal-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Whatever that is. LEX FRIDMAN: But you
have to remember, at the end of World War I,
as Woodrow Wilson called it, the war to end all wars. Nobody ironically,
in a dark way, it was also the roaring 20s
when people believed this. There will never be
another World War. And 20 years after that,
the rise of Nazi Germany. A charismatic leader
that captivated the minds of
millions and built up a military that can
take on the whole world. And so it makes you realize
that this is still possible. This is still possible. And then the tension. You see this-- the media
machine, the propaganda machine, that I've gotten
to see every aspect of. It's still fueling that division
between America and China. Between Russia and India. And then Africa has
a complicated thing that's trying to figure
out who are they with, who are they against. And just this tension is
building and building. And like it makes you
realize like we might-- the thing that might
shake human civilization may not be so far off. That's a realization
you get to really feel. I mean, there's all
kinds of other lessons. And one of which is propaganda. Is I got to-- I get a lot of letters, emails. And some of them are full
of really intense language, full of hate from
every side toward me. Or, well, the hate is
towards me as representing side X. And X stands as a
variable for every side. So either I'm a Zelensky
show, or I'm a Putin show, or I'm a NATO show,
or I'm an America-- America show--
American empire show. Or I'm a Democrat
or a Republican. Because it's already been,
in this country, politicized. I think there's a sense of
Ukraine is this place that's full of corruption. Why are we sending money there? I think that's kind
of the messaging on the Republican side. On the Democratic side-- I'm not even keeping track
of the actual messaging and the conspiracy theories
and the narratives, but they are-- the
tension is there. And I get to feel it directly. And what you get to
really experience is there's a large
number of narratives that all are extremely
confident themselves that they know the truth. People are convinced,
first of all, that they're not being lied to. People in Russia think
there's no propaganda. They think that,
yes, yes, there is like state-sponsored
propaganda, but we're all smart enough to ignore the lame
propaganda that's everywhere. They know that we can think
on our own, we know the truth, and everybody kind of
speaks in this way. Everybody in the
United States says, well, yes, there's
mainstream media, they're full of messaging and
propaganda, but we're smart. We can think on our own. Of course, we see through that. Everybody says this. And then the conclusion
of their thought is often hatred towards some
group, whatever that group is. And the more you've
lost, the more intense the feeling of hatred. It's a really
difficult field to walk through calmly and
with an open mind and try to understand
what's really going on. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
It's super intense. That's the only words that
come to mind as I hear this. You mentioned something that
it seems that hate generalizes. It's against an entire
group or an entire country. Why do you think it is that
hate generalizes and that love may or may not generalize? LEX FRIDMAN: I've
had-- sort of one, as you can imagine, the
kind of question I asked is, do you have love
or hate in your heart? It's a question I
asked almost everybody. And then I would dig
into this exact question that you're asking. I think some of the most
beautiful things I've heard which is people
that are full of hate are able to
self-introspect about it. They know they shouldn't feel
it, but they can't help it. It's not-- they know that
ultimately the thing that helps them and helps everyone
is to feel love for fellow man, but they can't help it. They know. It's like a drug, they
say like hate escalates, it's like a vicious spiral. You just can't help it. And the question I
also asked is, do you think you'll ever be
able to forgive Russia? And after much thought almost-- it's split, but most
people will say no. I will never be able to forgive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And because
of the generalization you talked about earlier, that
could even include all Ru-- LEX FRIDMAN: All Russians. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
In that statements, they mean all Russians. LEX FRIDMAN: Because
if you do nothing that's as bad or worse
than being part of the army that invades. So the people that are
just sitting there, the good Germans, the people
that are just quietly going on with their lives, you're
just as bad, if not worse, is their perspective. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Earlier, you said that going over
to the Ukraine now allowed you to
realize just so many of the positives of being
here in the United States. I have a good friend. We both know him. I won't name him
by name, but we've communicated the
three of us from tier-one Special Operations. He spent years
doing deployments. Really amazing individual. And I remember when the pandemic
hit, he said on a text thread you know, Americans aren't used
to the government interfering with their plans. Around the world,
many people are familiar with governments
dramatically interfering with their plans. Sometimes even in a
seemingly random way. Here we were not
braced for that. I mean, we get speeding
tickets, and there's lines to vote and things like that. But I think the pandemic
was one of the first times, at least in my life, that I
can remember where it really seemed like the government was
impeding what people naturally wanted to do. And that was a shock
for people here. And I have a what might
seem like a somewhat mundane question,
but it's something that I saw on social media. A lot of people were
asking me to ask you, and I was curious about too. What was a typical
day like over there? Were sleeping in a bed, were
you sleeping on the ground? Everyone seems to want to know. What were you eating? Were you eating once a day? Were you eating your steak? Or were you-- were you in fairly
deprived conditions over there? I saw a couple photos
that you posted out of doors in front of rubble. With pith helmet on in one case. What was that typical
day like over there? LEX FRIDMAN: So
there's two modes. One of them-- I spent
a lot of time in Kyiv, which is much safer than-- it may be obvious to state
but for people who don't know, it's in the middle
of the country, and it's much safer
than the actual front. The word the battle
is happening. So much, much safer
than Kyiv even is Lviv which is the
Western part of the country. So the times I
spent in Kyiv were fundamentally different than
the time I spent at the front. And I went to the
Kherson region, which is where a lot of really
heated battle was happening. There's several areas. So there's Kharkiv. It's in the Northeast
of the country. And then there's Donbas region,
which is East of the country. And then there's Kherson
region, which, by the way, I'm not good at geography, so
is the Southeast of the country. And that's where, at
least when I was there, was a lot of really
heated fighting happening. So when I was in
the Kherson region, it's what you would imagine. The place-- I stayed in a
hotel where all the lights have to stay off. So the entire town,
all the lights are off. You have to navigate
through the darkness and use your phone
to shine, and so on. ANDREW HUBERMAN: This is
terrible for the circadian system. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: That's exactly-- I was this-- how can I do this? Where's my element
and Athletic Greens? How can I function? No. There's I think it was balanced
by the deep appreciation of being alive. [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Right now I-- mean, this is the reason
that I asked-- LEX FRIDMAN: Stress-wise. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
This is the reason I ask is we get used to all
these creature comforts. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
we don't need them, but we often come
to depend on them in a way that makes us
feel like we need them. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
but very quickly, there's something about
the intensity of life that you see in people's
eyes because they're living through a war that makes
you forget all those creature comforts. And it was actually-- I'm somebody who hates
traveling and so on. I love the creature habits. I love-- I love the
comfort of the ritual right but all of that was
forgotten very quickly. Just the intensity of
feeling, the intensity of love that people have for
each other, that was obvious. In terms of food-- so there's a curfew. So depends on what
part of the country. But usually, you basically have
to scamper home like 9:00 PM. So the hard curfew in a lot of
places is 11:00 PM at night. But by then, you
have to be home. So-- in some places, it's 10:00. So at 9:00 PM, you
start going home. Which, for me, was
kind of wonderful also because I get to spend-- I get to be forced to spend time
alone and think for many hours in wherever I'm staying. Which is really nice. And everywhere there's a
calmness and the quietness to the whole thing. In terms of food, once a day. Just the food is incredibly
cheap and incredibly delicious. People are still--
one of the things they can still take pride
in is making the best possible food they can. So meat-- but they do
admire American meat, so the meat is not as great as
it could be in that country. But I ate borsch every day,
all that kind of stuff. Mostly meat. So spend the entire day-- wake up in the
morning with coffee, spend the entire day
talking to people. Which for me is very
difficult because of the intensity of the story. It's one after the
other after the other. We just talk to regular
people, talk to soldiers, talk to politicians,
all kinds of soldiers. I talked to people there who
are doing rescue missions, so Americans. I hung out with Tim Kennedy. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah? The great Tim Kennedy. LEX FRIDMAN: The great
Tim Kennedy, who-- also him and many
others revealed to me one of the many
reasons I'm proud to be an American is how trained
and skilled and effective American soldiers are. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I guess for
listeners of this podcast maybe we should familiarize
them with who Tim Kennedy is because I
realized that a number of them will know, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: How do you do that? How do you try to
summarize a man? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. We can be accurate
but not exhaustive, as any good data are
accurate but not exhaustive. Very skilled and accomplished
MMA fighter, very skilled and accomplished former
Special Operations member, American Patriot, and
podcaster too, right? Does he have his own podcast? LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.
LEX FRIDMAN: Maybe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We know Andy
Stumpf has his own podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes.
ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: Which is
an amazing podcast. Yeah, Andy's great. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Clearing Hot podcast
with Andy Stumpf. LEX FRIDMAN: But
also Tim Kennedy is like the embodiment of
America to the most beautiful and the most ridiculous degree. So he's like what you imagine-- what is it, Team America? I just imagine him
shirtless on a tank rolling into enemy territory
just screaming at the top of his lungs. That's just his personality. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
But not posturing. He actually does the
work, as they say. LEX FRIDMAN: So
this is the thing. He really embodies that. Now, some of that is just
his personality and humor. I'd like to sort of comment
on the humor of things, not just with him. There's very one other
interesting thing I've learned. But also when he's
actually helping people he's extremely good
at what he does, which is building
teams that rescue, that go into the most dangerous areas
of Ukraine, dangerous areas anywhere else, and
they get the job done. And one of the things I
heard time and time again, which what's really
interesting to me, that Ukrainian soldiers said
that comparing Ukrainian, Russian, and American
soldiers, American soldiers are the bravest, which was
very interesting for me to hear given how
high the morale is for the Ukrainian soldiers. But that just
reveals that training enables you to be brave. So it's not just about how well
trained they are and so on, it's how intense and ferocious
they are in the fighting. And it makes you realize,
this is American army, not just through the technology,
especially the special force guys. They're still one of
the most effective and terrifying
armies in the world. And listen, just
for context, I'm somebody who is, for the most
part, anti-war, a pacifist. But you get to see some of the
realities of war kind of wake you up to what needs to get
done to protect sovereignty, to protect some of the values,
to protect civilians and homes and all that kind of stuff. Sometimes war has to happen. And I should also
mention the Russian side because while I haven't gotten
to experience the Russian side yet I do fully plan to travel to
Russia, as I've told everybody. I was very upfront with
everybody about this. I would like to hear
the story of Russians. But I do know from the Ukrainian
side, like the grandmas-- I love grandmas. They told me stories that
the Russians really-- the ones that entered their
villages, they really, really believed they're saving
Ukraine from Nazis, from Nazi occupation. So they feel that
Ukraine is under control of Nazi organizations
and they believe they're saving
the country that's their brothers and sisters. I think propaganda and I think
truth is a very difficult thing to arrive with in that war zone. I think in the 21st
century one of the things you realize that so much of war,
even more so than in the past, is an information war. And people that just use Twitter
for their source of information might be surprised to know
how much misinformation there is on Twitter, like real
narratives being sold, and so it's really hard
to know who to believe. And through all of that you
have to try to keep an open mind and ultimately
ignore the powerful and listen to actual
citizens, actual people. That's the other
maybe obvious lesson is that war is waged by
powerful, rich people, and it's the poor
people that suffer. And that's just visible
time and time again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You mentioned
the fact that people still enjoy food or the
pleasure of cooking, or there's occasional humor
or maybe frequent humor. I know Jocko Willink has
talked about this in warfare in that all the elements of
the human spirit and condition still emerge at various times. I find this amazing,
and you and I have had conversations
about this before, but the aperture of the mind. The classic story
that comes to mind is the one of Viktor
Frankl or Nelson Mandela. You put somebody into a
small box of confinement and some people break
under those conditions and other people
find entire stories within a centimeter
of concrete that can occupy them, real stories
and richness or humor or love or fascination and surprise. And I find this so interesting
that the mind is so adaptable. We talked about creature
comforts and then lack of creature comforts and
the way that we can adapt, and yet, humans are
always striving, it seems, or one would hope,
for these better conditions to better their conditions. So as you've come back-- and you've been here
now back in the States for how long after your trip? LEX FRIDMAN: Depends
on this podcast release but it felt
like I've never left, so practically
speaking, a couple months. ANDREW HUBERMAN: OK. Yeah. And we won't be shy. We're recording
this mid-September. LEX FRIDMAN: We actually
recorded this several years ago so we're anticipating
in the future. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
This is where we're going to start telling you this
is a simulation, you and Joe. I'm still trying to figure
out what that actually means. I'd like to take a quick
break and acknowledge one of our sponsors,
Athletic Greens. Athletic Greens, now called AG1,
is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that covers all of your
foundational nutritional needs. I've been taking Athletic
Greens since 2012 so I'm delighted that they're
sponsoring the podcast. The reason I started taking
Athletic Greens and the reason I still take Athletic Greens,
once or usually twice a day, is that it gets
me the probiotics that I need for gut health. Our gut is very important. It's populated by
gut microbiota that communicate with the brain, the
immune system, and basically all the biological
systems of our body to strongly impact our
immediate and long term health, and those probiotics
in Athletic Greens are optimal and vital
for microbiotic health. In addition, Athletic
Greens contains a number of adaptogens,
vitamins, and minerals that make sure that all of my
foundational nutritional needs are met, and it tastes great. If you'd like to try
Athletic Greens you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
and they'll give you five free travel packs that make it really
easy to mix up Athletic Greens while you're on the road, in the
car, on the plane, et cetera, and they'll give you a year
supply of vitamin D3, K2. Again, that's
athleticgreens.com/huberman to get the five free travel
packs and the year supply of vitamin D3, K2. I know I speak for
many people when I say that we are very
happy that you're back. We know that it's not going
to be the first and last trip, that there will be
others, and that you'll be going to Russia as well
and presumably other places as well in order to explore. And I have to say, as a
podcaster and as your friend, I was really inspired at
your sense of adventure and your sense of
not just adventure, but thoughtful,
respectful adventure. You understood what
you were doing. You weren't just going there
to get some wartime footage or something. This wasn't a kick or a thrill. This is really serious
and remains serious. So thank you for doing it,
and please, next time you go, bring Tim Kennedy again. LEX FRIDMAN: I feel like
Tim Kennedy gets you into-- will take you because
he really loves going to the most dangerous
places and helping people. So I think he'd get me into
more trouble than it's worth. And I should mention
that, I mean, there's many reasons I
went, but it's definitely not something I take
lightly or want to do again. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. LEX FRIDMAN: So I'm doing
things that I don't want to do, I just feel like I have to. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
You're compelled. LEX FRIDMAN: So I
don't think there's-- now I'll definitely talk
about it, as we all should. There's different
areas of the world that are seeing a lot of suffering. Yemen. There's so many atrocities
going on in the world today, but this one is just
personal to me so I want to-- I feel like I'm qualified
just because of the language. So most of the talking,
by the way, I was doing, it was in Russian. And so because of the language,
because of my history, I felt like I had to do
this particular thing. I think it's, in many ways,
stupid and dangerous, and that was made clear to me. But I do many things
of this nature because the heart
pulls towards that. But also there's
a freedom to not-- I'm afraid of death, but I
think there's a freedom to-- it's almost like,
OK, if I die, I want to take full advantage of
not having a family currently. I feel like when you
have a family there's a responsibility for others
so you immediately become more conservative and careful. I feel like I want to
take full advantage of this particular
moment in my life when you can be a little
bit more accepting of risk. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
you should definitely reproduce at some point. Maybe before next time you
should just freeze some sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: I-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Really, that-- LEX FRIDMAN: Is that what
you do with ice baths? Is how that works? ANDREW HUBERMAN: You
know, it's interesting. There's always an opportunity
to do some science protocols. You know that there are
products on the internet, and there are actually a few
decent manuscripts looking at how cold exposure can
increase testosterone levels, but it doesn't happen
by the cold directly. Good scientists, as the authors
of those papers, were and are, realized that it's the
vasoconstriction and then the vasodilation. As people warm up again
there's increased blood flow to the testicles,
and in women it seems there's probably
increased blood flow to the reproductive organs as
well after people warm back up. So that seems to cause some
sort of hyper nourishment of the various cells, the
Sertoli and Leydig cells of the testes that
lead to increased output of testosterone and in
women testosterone as well. So the cold exposure in
any case is obviously a-- do you do the ice bath? Are you into that? LEX FRIDMAN: I've
not done that yet. ANDREW HUBERMAN: As a
Russian you probably consider that a hot tub. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It's a nice thing to have fun
with every once in a while to warm up. No, I haven't done that. Been kind of waiting
to maybe do it together with you at some point. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Great. LEX FRIDMAN: Because
we have a guide. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
We have one here. It'll be
straightforward for you. I always say that the
adrenaline comes in waves, and so if you just
think about it walls, like you're going through a
number of walls of adrenaline as opposed to going for time,
it becomes rather trivial. With your jujitsu
background and what you'll immediately recognize
the physiological sensation. Even though it's
cold specifically, it's the adrenaline
that makes you want to hop out of the thing. LEX FRIDMAN: And
you've seen Joe's. So Joe set up a
really nice man cave-- or it's not even a cave
because it's so big. It's like a network
of man caves. But it has a ice bath and
a sauna next to each other. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We have one of
those here, ice bath and sauna. So we'll have to get you
in it one of these days. LEX FRIDMAN: Sounds
like trouble. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe
tonight, maybe tomorrow. No, although there is a-- I don't know the underlying
physiological basis but there does seem to
be a trend toward truth telling in the sauna. Some people will refer
to them as truth barrels. Mine's a barrel sauna
shaped like a barrel. Who knows why? Maybe under intense
heat duress people just feel compelled to share. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, I have
a complicated relationship with saunas because of
all the weight cutting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh. LEX FRIDMAN: Some of
the deepest suffering-- sorry to interrupt-- I've done was in the sauna. It's very-- I mean, I've gone
to some dark places in a sauna because, I mean, I wrestled
my whole life, judo, jujitsu, and those weights cuts
can really test the mind. So you're-- truth telling. Yeah, it's a certain
kind of truth telling because
you're sitting there and the clock moves slower than
it has ever moved in your life. Yeah. So I usually, for
the most part, I would try to have a bunch of
sweats, garbage bags, and all that kind of stuff, and run. It's easier because you
can distract the mind. In the sauna you can't
distract the mind. It's just and all the excuses
and all the weaknesses in your mind just
coming to the surface, and you're just sitting there
and sweating-- or not sweating. That's the worst. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And talk
about visual aperture. You're in a small box so it also
inspires some claustrophobia even if you're not
claustrophobic. That's absolutely true. And the desire to just
get out of the thing is where you get a pretty
serious adrenaline surge from in the sauna as well. Now, the sauna actually will-- it won't deplete testosterone
but it kills sperm. So for people that-- sperm are on a 60
day sperm cycle so if you're trying
to donate sperm-- because that's what
got us on to this-- or fertilize an egg or
eggs in whatever format, dish or in vivo, as we say
in science, which means-- well, you can look it up, folks. The 60 day sperm cycle. So if you go into
a really hot sauna or a hot bath or a
hot tub, in 60 days those sperm are going to be-- a significantly
greater portion of them will be dead, will
be non-viable. So there's a simple solution. People just put ice pack down
there or a jar, not this jar, but a jar of cold fluid between
their legs and just sit there, or they go back and
forth between the ice bath and the sauna. But you probably-- if you're
going to go back over there you should freeze sperm. We're going to do a couple
episodes on fertility when it's relatively inexpensive. And you're young so
you probably do it now because there is a association
with autism as males get older. It's not a strong one. It's significant but it's
still a small contribution to the autism phenotype. LEX FRIDMAN: As you age
don't sperm get wiser or no? There's no science to back that? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, but men
can conceive healthy children at a considerable age. But in any case-- but no, they don't get wiser. What happens is interesting-- LEX FRIDMAN: Finely aged steak. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, it's a
little bit like the maturation of the brain in the sense
that some of the sperm get much better at swimming
and then many of them get less good. Motility is a strong correlate
of the DNA of the sperm. LEX FRIDMAN: This is
probably a good time to announce that I'm
selling my sperm as an NFTs. I wanted to see how much that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh my goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Riding
the crypto wave. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, your
children, your future children and my future children, are
supposed to do jujitsu together since I've only done
the one jujitsu class so I'm strongly vested
in you having children. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But only
in the friendly kind of way. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yes. Friendly competition
kind of way. Yeah. Dominance of the clan. Yep. For sure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So moving
on to science, but still with our minds in the Ukraine. Did you encounter any scientists
or see any universities? As we know, in this country
and in Europe and elsewhere, science takes infrastructure. You need buildings, you need
laboratories, you need robots, you need a lot of equipment,
and you need minus 80 freezers and you need incubators
and you need money and you need technicians. And typically it's been
the wealthier countries that have been able to
do more research for sake of research and development
and prioritization. Certainly the Ukraine had
some marvelous universities and marvelous scientists. What's going on with science
and scientists over there? And gosh, can we even
calculate the loss of discovery that is occurring as a
consequence of this conflict? LEX FRIDMAN: So science goes on. Before the war Ukraine had
a very vibrant tech sector, which means engineering
and all that kind of stuff, and Kyiv has a lot of
excellent universities and they still go on. The biggest hit, I
would say, is not the infrastructure
of the science, but the fact, because
of the high morale, everybody is joining
the military. So everybody is
going to the front to fight, including you, Andrew
Huberman, would be fighting, and not because you have
to but because you want to. And everybody you know
would be really proud that you're fighting,
even though everyone tries to convince, Andrew
Huberman, you have much better
ways to contribute. There's deep honor in fighting
for your country, yes, but there are better ways to
contribute to your country than just picking up a gun that
you're not that trained with and going to the front. Still, they do it. Scientists, engineers,
CEOs, professors, students-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Men and women? LEX FRIDMAN: Actors--
men and women. Obviously, primarily
men, but men and women. Much more than you would
see in other militaries, women are-- everybody. Everybody wants to fight. Everybody's proud of fighting. There's no discussion
of pacifism. Should we be fighting? Is this right? Is this-- everybody's
really proud of fighting. So there's this
kind of black hole that pulls everything,
all the resources, into the war effort that's
not just financial but also psychological. So it's like if you're a
scientist it feels like what-- it feels almost like
you're dishonoring humanity by continuing to do things
you were doing before. There's a lot of people that
converted to being soldiers. They literally watch
a YouTube video of how to shoot
a particular gun, how to arm a drone
with a grenade. If you're a tech
person you know how to work with drones so
you're going to use that, use whatever skills you got,
figure out whatever skills you got and how to use them to
help the effort on the front. And so that's a big hit. But that said, I've talked
to a lot of folks in Kyiv-- faculty primarily in the
tech economics space, so I didn't get a chance
to interact with folks who are on the biology, chemistry,
neuroscience side of things, but that still goes on. So one of the really
impressive things about Ukraine is that they're able to maintain
infrastructure like road, food supply, all that kind of stuff,
education, while the war is going on, especially in Kyiv. The war started
where nobody knew whether Kyiv was going to be
taken by the Russian forces. It was surrounded. And a lot of experts from
outside were convinced that Russia would take
Kyiv, and they didn't. And one of the really
impressive things as a leader-- one of the things I
really experienced is that a lot of people
criticized Zelenskyy before the war. He only had about
30% approval rate. A lot of people
didn't like Zelenskyy. But one of the
great things he did as a leader, which I'm not
sure many leaders would be able to do, is when Kyiv
was clearly being invaded he chose to stay. He stayed in the capital. Everybody, all the American
military, the intelligence agencies, NATO, his own staff,
advisors all told him to flee, and he stayed. And so I think that was a
beacon, a symbol for the rest, for the universities,
for science, for the infrastructure
that we're staying too, and that kept the
whole thing going. There's an interesting social
experiment that happened, I think for folks who
are interested in gun control in this
country in particular, is one of the decisions
they made early on is to give guns to everybody. Semi-automatics. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Early on in the war? LEX FRIDMAN: Early
on in the war, yeah. So everybody got a gun. They also released
a bunch of prisoners from prison because
there was no staff to keep the prisons running. And so there's a
very interesting psychological experiment of,
like, how is this going to go? Everybody has a gun. Are they going to
start robbing places? Are they going to
start taking advantage of a chaotic situation? And what happened is
that crime went to zero. So it turned out that
this, as an experiment, worked wonderfully. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a
case where love generalized. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or
at least hate did not. We don't know if it's
love or it's sort of lack of initiative for common
culture directed hate. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. I don't-- right. I think that's very correct
to say that it wasn't hate that was unifying people. It was love of country,
love of community. It's probably the same thing
that will happen to humans when aliens invade as well. It's the common effort. Everybody puts everything
else to the side. Plus just the sheer amount
of guns is similar to Texas. You realize, well,
there's going to be a self-correcting mechanism very
quickly because the rule of law was also put aside, right? Basically the police
force lost a lot of power because everybody else
has guns and they're kind of taking the law
into their own hands. That system, at least
in this particular case in this particular moment
in human history, worked. It's an interesting
lesson, you know? ANDREW HUBERMAN: It is. I had an interesting contrast
that I'll share with you because you mentioned Texas. So not so long ago
I was in Austin. I often visit you or others
in Austin, as you know. And many doors that I walked
past, including a school, said no firearms
past this point. It was a sticker on the door. You see this on
hospitals sometimes. I saw this at Baylor College
of Medicine, et cetera. Relatively common
to see in Texas, not so common in California. And then I flew to the
San Francisco Bay Area, was walking by an elementary
school in my old neighborhood, and saw a similar
sticker and looked at it and it said, no peanuts
or other allergy containing foods past
this point on the door of this elementary school. So quite a different
contrast, guns and peanuts. Now, peanut allergies,
obviously, are very serious for some people, although
there's great research out of Stanford showing that
early exposure to peanuts can prevent the allergies. But don't start rubbing yourself
in peanut butter, folks, if you have a peanut allergy. That's not the best
way to deal with it. In any case, the
contrast of what's dangerous, the contrast of
the familiarity with guns versus no familiarity. In Israel and elsewhere you see
machine guns in the airport. In Germany, Frankfurt, you see
machine guns in the airport. Not so common in
the United States. So again, I feel like there's
this aperture of vision. There's this aperture of
pleasures versus creature comforts and lack of
creature comforts, and then there's this
aperture of danger, right? People who are
familiar with guns are familiar with people
coming in and setting their firearm on the table
and eating dinner, you know? But if you're not accustomed
to that it's jarring, right? LEX FRIDMAN: I should mention-- people know this
throughout human history-- but the human ability
to get assimilated now, get used to violence
is incredible. So you could be living
in a peaceful time, like we're here now, and
there would be one explosion, like a 9/11 type of situation. That would be a huge shock. It's terrifying. Everybody freaks out. The second one is a huge drop
off in how freaked out you get. And in a matter of
days, sometimes hours, it becomes the normal. I've talked to so many
people in Kharkiv, which is one of the towns that's
seen a lot of heated battle. You ask them, is it safe there? In fact, when I went to the-- closer and closer to the
war zone you ask people, is it safe? And their answer's usually,
yeah, it's pretty safe. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
all signal to noise. LEX FRIDMAN: Nobody has told
me except Western reporters sitting in the West
Side of Ukraine, it's really dangerous here. Everyone's like,
yeah, it's good. My uncle just died yesterday. He was shot. But it's pretty good. The farm is still running. How do I put it? They focus on the
positive, that's one. But there's a
deeper truth there, which is just get used
to difficult situations and the stuff that
make you happy and the stuff that
make you upset is relative to that new
normal that you establish. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
I grew up in California and there were a
lot of earthquakes. I remember the '89
quake, I remember the Embarcadero
Freeway pancaking on top of people and cars. I remember I moved to
Southern California, there was a Northridge quake. Wherever I move there
seem to be earthquakes. I never worry about
earthquakes, ever. I just don't. In fact, I don't
like the destruction they cause, but every once
in a while an earthquake will roll through and it's
kind of exciting. It sounds like a
train coming through. It's like, wow, like
the Earth is moving. You know? Again, I don't want
anyone to get harmed, but I enjoy a good rumble
coming through nonetheless. It's signal to noise. But if I saw a
tornado I'd freak out, and people from the Midwest
are probably comfortable with-- Dan Gable, the great
wrestler from the Midwest that you know and I've
never met but I have great respect for, he's
probably-- sees a tornado and is like, ah, yeah. Maybe. Yeah. You know? So I think signal
to noise is real. Before I neglect,
although I won't forget, speaking of signal
to noise and environment, you are returning
to or have gone back to one of your original
natural habitats, which is the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology which is-- LEX FRIDMAN: Natural
habitat, yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's actually
difficult to pronounce in full. MIT, right? So you've been spending some
time there teaching and doing other things. Tell us what you're up
to with MIT recently. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, I'm
really glad that you, being on the West Coast, know
the difference between Boston, New York. I feel like a lot of people
think it's like the East Coast. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's
very different, especially the Bostonians and New Yorkers. LEX FRIDMAN: They
get very aggressive. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh my goodness. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I love it. I gave lectures there in
front of a in person crowd. ANDREW HUBERMAN: What
were you talking about? LEX FRIDMAN: For the
AI, so different aspects of AI and robotics, machine
learning-- machine learning. So for people who know the
artificial intelligence field they usually don't
use the term AI, and people from outside AIs. The biggest breakthroughs
in the machine learning field with some
discussion of robotics and so on. Yeah. It was in person. It was wonderful. I'm a sucker for that. I really avoided teaching
or any kind of interaction during COVID because people
put a lot of emphasis on but also got comfortable
with remote teaching, and I think nobody enjoyed it. Except there's a notion
that it's much easier to do because you don't
have to travel. You can do it in your
pajamas kind of thing. But when you actually
get to do it, you don't get the
same kind of joy that you do when
you're teaching. As a student you don't get the
same kind of joy of learning. It's not as effective and
all that kind of stuff. So to be in person together
with people, to see their eyes, to get their excitement, to
get the questions and all the interactions,
that was awesome. And I'm still a sucker and a
believer in the ideal of MIT, of the University. I think it's an
incredible place. There's something
in the air still. But it really hit-- the pandemic hit
universities hard because-- and I can say this. This is not you saying it. This is me saying it. That administrations--
as in all cases when people criticize
institutions, the pandemic has given more
power to the administration and taken away power from
the faculty and the students, and that's from
everybody involved, including the administration. That's a concern
because a university is about the teachers
and the students. That should be primary. And whenever you have
a pandemic there's an opportunity to increase
the amount of rules. One of the things that
really bothered me, and I'll scream from
the top of the MIT dome, about this is they've instituted
a new temp ticket system. Which is if you're a visitor
to the campus at MIT, you have to register. You have to, first of all,
show that you're vaccinated, but more importantly, there's
a process to visiting. You need to get
permission to visit. One of the reasons I loved MIT,
unlike some other institutions, MIT just leaves the
door open to anyone. In classrooms you can roll
in the ridiculous characters. The students that
are usually doing business stuff or economics
can roll into a physics class and just-- you're
kind of not allowed but it's a gray area
so you let that happen, and that creates a flourishing
of a community that was beautiful. And I think adding extra rules
puts a squeeze on and limits some of the
flourishing, and I hope some of that
dissipates over time as we kind of let go of
the risk aversion that was created by the pandemic. As we kind of enter
the normal return back some of that
flourishing can happen. But when you're actually
in there with the students, it was magic. I love it. I love it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, some
of your earliest videos on your YouTube channel were
of you in the classroom, right? That's how this all started. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Yeah. That's how YouTube--
putting stuff on YouTube is terrifying, right? ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, especially at the time when you did it. Again, you're a
pioneer in that sense. You did that, Jordan
Peterson did that. Putting up lectures is-- yeah. I teach still. Every winter I teach-- direct a course, and I'll
be doing even more teaching going forward. But the idea of those
videos being on the web is-- yeah, that spikes my
cortisol a little bit. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. It's terrifying
because you get-- and everybody has a
different experience. For me being a junior
research scientist the kind of natural
concern is like, who am I? And when I was giving
this lecture it's like, I don't deserve any of this. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's your
humility coming through, and I actually
think that humility on the part of an
instructor is good because those that think that
they are entitled, and who else could give this lecture? Then I worry more. I once heard-- I don't
know if it's still true-- that at Caltech,
the great California Institute of Technology
not far from here, that many of the
faculty are actually afraid of the students. Not physically
afraid, but they're intellectually afraid because
the students are so smart. And teaching there can
be downright frightening, I've heard. But that's great. Keeps everybody on their toes. And you know, I've been
corrected in lecture before at Stanford
and elsewhere. When my lab was at UC San
Diego where someone will say, hey, wait, last lecture you said
this and now you said that-- or on the podcast. You know? And I think it's that
moment where you sometimes feel that urge to defend and
you go, oh, you're right, and I think it depends
on how one was trained. My graduate advisor was
wonderful at saying, I don't know, all the time. And she went to Harvard,
Radcliffe, UCSF, and Caltech. Brilliant woman. And had no problem
saying, I don't know. LEX FRIDMAN: I don't
have that problem either. So I usually have two guys
that somebody speaks up, grab them, drag them out of
the room, never see them again. So everybody is
really supportive. You don't understand that the
amount of love and support I get is-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Especially when
the last few students are there and everybody seems to be
nodding as you're going. No, I think that I'd love to
sit-in on one of your lectures. I know very little about AI,
machine learning, or robotics. But-- LEX FRIDMAN: Have you
ever talked at MIT? Have you ever given lectures? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. When I went on the job market
as a faculty member my final two choices were between
MIT Picower-- I had an on-paper offer. Wonderful place. Wonderful place to
do neuroscience. And UC San Diego, which is a
wonderful neuroscience program. In the end it made
sense for me be on the West Coast
for personal reasons, but there's some amazing
neuroscience going on there. Goodness. And that's always been true
and is going to continue. It's been a long time since
I've been invited back there. Oddly enough when I started
doing more podcasting-- and I still run a lab but I
shrunk my lab considerably as I've done more podcasting-- I've received fewer
academic lecture invites, which makes sense. But now they're
sort of coming back. And so when people
invite now I always say, do you want me to talk
about the ventral thalamus and its role in
anxiety and aggression or do you want me to
talk about the podcast? And my big fear is
I'm going to go back to give a lecture about
the retina or something and I'll start off with
an Athletic Greens read or something like
that just reflexively. Just kidding. That wouldn't happen. But listen, I think
it's great to continue to keep a foot in both places. I was so happy to
hear that you're teaching at MIT because
podcasting is one thing, teaching is another, and
there's overlap there in the Venn diagram. But listen, the students
that get to sit-in on one of your
lectures-- and you may see me sitting
there in the audience soon when I creep
into your class. LEX FRIDMAN: In sunglasses. ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's right. Wearing a red shirt. You won't recognize me. Are certainly
receiving a great gift. I've watched your lectures on
YouTube, even the early ones, and listen, I know you to
be a phenomenal teacher. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
there's something about-- so I'm also doing-- I stayed up pretty
late last night working for a
deadline on a paper. One of the things
that I hope to do for hopefully the rest of my
life is to continue publishing, and I think it's really
important to do that even if you continue the podcast
because you want to be just on your own intellectual
and scientific journey as you do podcasting. At least for me, and especially
on the engineering side because I want to
build stuff, and I think that keeps
your ego in check, keeps you humble
because I think if you talk too much on a microphone
you start getting-- you might lose track
of the grounding that comes from engineering
and from science and the scientific process and
the criticisms that you get, all that kind of stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And how
slow and iterative it is. We have two papers right now
that are in the revision stage, and it's been a very long road. And I was asked this recently
because I met with my chairman. He said, do you want to
continue to run a lab or are you just going to go
full time on the podcast? And Stanford has been very
supportive, I must say, as I know MIT has been of you. And I said, oh,
I absolutely want to continue to be involved
in research and do research. And when you start
talking about these papers and we're looking over my--
this was my yearly review and looking back
I'm like, goodness, these papers have been in
play for a very long time. So it's a long road but
you learn more and more, and the more time you
spend myopically looking at a bunch of data the more you
learn and the more you think. I totally agree. Talking to these
devices for podcasts is wonderful because it's fun. It relieves a certain itch that
we both have and hopefully it lands some important information
out there for people, but doing research is the-- I guess if you know, you know. There's the unpeeling
of the onion, knowing that there could
be something there. There's just nothing like it. LEX FRIDMAN: I mean, you do-- especially with the pandemic. And for me, both
Twitter and the podcast have made me much more
impatient about the slowness of the review process because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Twitter will do that. LEX FRIDMAN: Twitter will. But even with podcast
you have a cool-- you'll find something cool
and then you have ideas and you'll just say them and
they'll be out pretty quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Then we do a
post right now about something that we both found interesting
and it's out in the world. Yep. LEX FRIDMAN: And
you can write up something, like there
is a culture in computer science of posting stuff
on arXiv and preprints that don't get annual review,
and sometimes they don't even go through the review process
ever because people just start using them if it's code. And it's like, what's
the point of this? It works. It's self evident that it works
because people are using it, and that I think applies
more to engineering fields because it's an actual
tool that works. It doesn't matter if-- you don't
have to scientifically prove that it works. It works because it's
using for a lot of people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, sorry
to interrupt, but I just-- for point of reference,
the famous paper describing the
double helix which earned Watson and
Crick the Nobel Prize and should have earned Rosalind
Franklin Nobel Prize too, of course, but they got it for
the structure of DNA of course. That paper was never
reviewed at Nature. They published it because its
importance was self evident, or whatever. They decided-- LEX FRIDMAN: So the editors. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It was that
purely editorial decision, I believe. I mean, that's what I
was told by someone who's currently an editor at Nature. If that turns out
to not be correct someone will tell us in
the comments for sure. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, I think-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: That's
pretty interesting, right? LEX FRIDMAN: That's
really interested. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Perhaps the
most significant discovery in biology and
bioengineering which was leading to
bioengineering as well, of course, of the last
century was not peer reviewed. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, but-- so Eric Weinstein,
but many others have talked about
this, which is, I mean, I don't think people understand
how poor the peer review process is. Just the amount of--
because you think peer review it means all the
best peers get together and they review your
stuff, but it's unpaid work and it's usually a
small number of people. And they have a very
select perspective so they might not be the
best person, especially if it's super novel work. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And it's
who has time to do it. I'm on a bunch of
editorial boards still. Why, I don't know, but I
enjoy the peer review process and sending papers out. Oftentimes the best
scientists are very busy and don't have time to review. And oftentimes the
more premiere journals will select from a kind
of a unique kit of very good scientists who are
very close to the work, sometimes the people are
very far from the work. It really depends. LEX FRIDMAN: And both
have negatives, right? If you're very close
to the work there's jealousy, and all those
basic human things. Very far from the
work you might not appreciate the
nuanced contribution, all that kind of stuff. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
there's psychology. Sorry to interrupt again, but
a good friend of mine who's extremely successful
neuroscientist, Howard Hughes
investigator, et cetera, always told me that they-- I won't even say whether
or not who they are. They select their
reviewers on the basis of who has been publishing
very well recently because they assume that that
person is going to be more benevolent because
they have been doing well so that the love expands. LEX FRIDMAN: That's a good
point to that, actually. But the idea is that
editors might actually be the best reviewers, so that
was the traditional-- that's the thing I wanted to mention
that Eric Weinstein talks about, that back several
decades ago editors had much more power. And there is something to be
made for that because editors are the ones who are responsible
for crafting the journal. They really are
invested in this, and they're also
often experts, right? It makes sense for
an editor to have a bit of power in this case. Usually if an idea is truly
novel you could see it, And so it makes
sense for an editor to have more power
in that regard. Of course for me,
I think peer review should be done the
way tweets are done, which is crowdsourced
or Amazon reviews. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Let
the crowd decide. LEX FRIDMAN: Let
the crowd decide, and let the crowd add depth
and breadth and context for the contribution. So if the paper overstates
the degree of contribution, the crowd will
check you on that. If there's not enough support
or the conclusions are not supported by the evidence, the
crowd will check you on that. There could be, of course,
political bickering that enters the
picture, especially on very controversial
topics, but I think I trust the
intelligence of human beings to figure that out. And I think most of us
are trying to figure this whole process out. I just wish it was
happening much faster because on the important
topics, the review cycle could be faster. And we learned
that through COVID that Twitter was
actually pretty effective at doing science communication. It was really interesting. Some of the best
scientists took to Twitter to communicate their own
work and other people's work, and always putting
into the caveats that it's not peer reviewed and
so on, but it's all out there and the data just moves so fast. And if you want
stuff to move fast, Twitter is the best medium
of communication for that. It's cool to see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like
to take a brief break and thank our sponsor,
InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a
personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data
from your blood and DNA to help you better
understand your body and help you reach
your health goals. I've long been a believer in
getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that
many of the factors that impact your immediate and
long term health can only be analyzed from
a quality blood test. The problem with a
lot of blood and DNA tests out there, however,
is that you get data back about metabolic
factors, lipids, and hormones and so forth, but you don't
know what to do with those data. InsideTracker
solves that problem and makes it very easy
for you to understand what sorts of nutritional,
behavioral, maybe even supplementation
based interventions you might want to
take on in order to adjust the numbers of those
metabolic factors, hormones, lipids, and other
things that impact your immediate and long
term health to bring those numbers into the
ranges that are appropriate and, indeed, optimal for you. If you'd like to try

more regularly, and initially it
was just Instagram. And I remember you and I used to
have these over dinner or drink conversations where I'd say,
I don't understand Twitter. And you'd say, I don't
understand Instagram. And of course, we
understand how it worked and how to work each
respective platform, but I think we were both
trying to figure out what is driving the psychology
of these different venues because they are quite distinct
psychologies for whatever reason. I think I'm finally starting
to understand Twitter and enjoy it a little bit. Initially I wasn't
prepared for the level of reflexive scrutiny. It sounds a little
bit oxymoronic, but that people pick
up on one small thing and then drive it
down that trajectory. It didn't seem to be happening
quite as much on Instagram, but I love your tweets. I do have a question
about your Twitter account and how you-- do you have sort
of internal filters of what you'll put up and won't put up? Because sometimes you'll
put up things that are about life and reflections. Other times you'll put up
things like what you're excited about in
AI, or of course, point to various podcasts
including your own, but others as well. How do you approach
social media? Not in how do you
regulate your behavior on there in terms of how
much time, et cetera. I know you've talked
about that before. But you know, what's your
mindset around social media when you go on there to either
post or forage or respond to information? LEX FRIDMAN: I think
I try to add some-- not the sound cliche, but some
love out there into the world into, as OJ Simpson
calls it, Twitter world. I think there is this viral
negativity that can take hold, and I try to find the right
language to add good vibes out there. And it's actually
really, really tricky because there's something about
positivity that sounds fake. I can't quite put
my finger on it, but whenever I talk about
love and positive and almost childlike in my curiosity
and positivity, people start to think, surely he
has skeletons in the closet. There's dead bodies
in his basement. This must be a fake-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
No, it's the attic. LEX FRIDMAN: It's the attic? ANDREW HUBERMAN: The attic. LEX FRIDMAN: I keep
mine in the basement. That's the details. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I was
referring to your attic. I don't have an attic or a
basement, nor dead bodies. I just want to be very clear. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. I do have an attic and actually
I haven't been up there. Maybe there is bodies up there. But yes, I prefer the basement. It's colder down there. I like it. No, but there's an assumption
that this is not genuine or it's disingenuous
in some kind of way. And so I try to find the
right language for that kind of stuff, how to be positive. Some of it I was really inspired
by Elon's approach to Twitter. Not all of it, but
when he just is silly. I found that silliness-- I think it's Hermann Hesse
said something to paraphrase-- one of my favorite writers-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, same. LEX FRIDMAN: I
think in Steppenwolf said, learn what is
to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest. I think I try to be
silly, laugh at myself, laugh at the absurdity
of life, and then in part when I'm serious, try to
just be positive, just to see a positive perspective. And also, as you said,
people pick out certain words and so on and they
attack each other, attack me over certain usage
of words in a particular tweet. I think the thing I try to do is
think positively towards them, like do not escalate. So whenever somebody's
criticizing me and so on, I just smile. If there's a lesson to
be learned, I learn it and then I just send
good vibes their way. Don't respond, and
just hopefully, through karma and through the
ripple effect of positivity, have an impact on them and
the rest of the Twitter. And what you find
is that builds-- your actions create
the community. So how I behave gets me
surrounded by certain people. But lately, especially Ukraine
is one topic like this, I also thought
about talking to-- somebody who reached out
to me is Andrew Tate, who's extremely controversial. From the perspective of a lot
of people is a misogynist. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
I've heard his name and I know that there's a lot
of controversy around him. Maybe you could familiarize me. I've been pretty nose
down in podcast prep and I tried to do this
vacation thing for about three, four weeks. LEX FRIDMAN: I've
heard about that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. And it sort of worked. I did get some time in
the Colorado wilderness by myself, which was great. I did get some downtime. But in any event, it mainly
consisted of reading and-- LEX FRIDMAN: And nature? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Reading
and nature, sauna, ice bath, working out, good food,
a little extra sleep, these kinds of things I
really felt I needed it. But I am pretty
naive when it comes to the kind of
current controversies but I've heard his
name, and I think he's been deplatformed
on a couple of platforms. Do I have that right? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, he's
been-- so I should also admit that while I might
know more than you, it's not by much. So it's like a
five-year-old talking to a four-year-old right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is he
an athlete, a podcaster? LEX FRIDMAN: So basic summary,
he used to be a fighter, a kickboxer, I believe. Was pretty successful. And then during
that and after that I think he was on
a reality show, and he had all these programs
that are basically pickup artist advice. He has this community of
people where he gives advice on how to pick up women, how to
be successful in relationships, how to make a lot of
money, and it costs money to enter those programs. So a lot of the criticism
that he gets is kind of-- it's like a pyramid scheme
where you convince people to join so that they
can make more money and then they convince others
to join, and that kind of stuff. But that's not why I'm
interested in talking to him. I'm interested because
one of the guests-- maybe I should mention who, but
one of the female guests I had, really a big scientist, said
that her two kids that are 13 and 12 really look up
to Andrew to entertain-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it male
children, female children? LEX FRIDMAN: Male. And I hear this
time and time again. So he is somebody that a lot of
teens, young teens, look up to. So I haven't done
serious research. I usually try to avoid doing
research until I agree to talk and then I go deep. But there is an
aspect to the way he talks about women that, while
I understand and I understand certain dynamics in
relationships work for people and he's one such
person, but I think him being really disrespectful
towards women is not what I-- it's not how I see what
it means to be a good man. So the conversation I
want to have with him is about masculinity. What does masculinity
mean in the 21st century? And so when I think
about that kind of stuff, and because we're
talking about Twitter, it's like going into a war zone. I'm a happy go
lucky person, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: You're
like, send me to Ukraine, but I don't want to have
this conversation on Twitter. LEX FRIDMAN: Because
it's a really, really, really tricky one because
also, as you know, when you do a podcast,
everybody wants you to win. It's everything
you do is positive. Maybe you'll say the wrong
thing as inaccurate thing and you can correct yourself. With Andrew Tate, with Donald
Trump, with folks like this, you have to-- I mean, it's a
professional boxing. I think you have
to push the person. You have to be really eloquent. You have to be also empathetic
because you can't just do what journalists
do, which is talk down to the person the entire time. That's easy. The hard thing is to
empathize with the person, to understand them, to
steel man their case, but also to make your own case. So in that case about what
it means to be a man, to me a strong man is somebody
who is respectful to women. Not out of weakness, not out
of social justice warrior signaling, and all that kind
of stuff, but out of that's what a strong man does. They don't need to be
disrespectful to prove their position in life. He is often-- now, a lot of
people say it's a character. He's being misogynistic. He's being a misogynist as a
kind of-- for entertainment purposes. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So like an avatar. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. But to me, that avatar has a
lot of influence on young folks so the character has impact. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Oh, I don't think you can separate the
avatar and the person in terms of the
impact, as you said. In fact, there are
a number of accounts on Twitter and Instagram and
elsewhere which people have only revealed their first
names or they give themself another name or they're
using a cartoon image. And part of that, I
believe, in at least from some of these individuals
who actually know who they are, I understand as an attempt to
maintain their privacy, which is important to many people. And in some cases so that
they can be more inflammatory and then just pop up
elsewhere as something else without anyone knowing
that it's the same person. LEX FRIDMAN: Some of--
this is the dark stuff. I've been reading a lot about
Ukraine and Nazi Germany, so the '30s and
the '40s and so on, and you get to see how
much the absurdity turns to evil quickly. One of the things I worry-- one of the things
I really don't like to see on Twitter
and the internet is how many statements
end with LOL. It's like you think just because
something is kind of funny or is funny or is
legitimately funny, it also doesn't have a
deep effect on society. So that's such a
difficult gray area because some of the best
comedy is dark and mean, but it reveals some important
truth that we need to consider. But sometimes comedy
is just covering up for destructive
ideology, and you have to know the line
between those two. Hitler was seen as a joke in
the late '20s and the '30s in Nazi Germany until the
joke became very serious. You have to be careful
to know the difference between the joke and the
reality and do all that. I mean, in a conversation-- I'm just such a big
believer in conversation to be able to reveal something
through conversation, but I don't know. One of the big-- you and I challenge
ourselves all the time. I don't know if I
have what it takes to have a good, empathetic,
but adversarial conversation. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I need to learn
more about this Tate person, or not learn about them. Yeah. It sounds like maybe
it's something to skip. I don't know because, again, I'm
not familiar with the content. But I was going to
ask you whether or not you've seeked out
or whether or not you would ever consider
having Donald Trump as a guest on your podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I've
talked to Joe a lot about this and I really believe I can have
a good conversation with Donald Trump, but I haven't seen many
good conversations with him. So part of me thinks-- part of me believes
it's possible, but he often effectively
runs over the interviewer. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You could
sit him down, give him an element in Athletic Greens. LEX FRIDMAN: Just relax. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That nice, cool, air conditioned black
curtain studio you've got and a different
side might come out. Context is powerful. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, Joe's
really good at this, which is relaxing the person. Like here, have a drink. Smoke a joint, or
whatever it is. But this energy of
just, let's relax, and there's laughter and so on. I don't think-- as
people know, I'm just not good at that kind of stuff. So I think the way I could have
a good conversation with him is to really understand
his worldview, be able to steel
man his worldview and those that support him. Which is, I'm sorry
to say for people who seem to hate Donald Trump,
is a very large percentage of the country. And so you have to really
empathize with those people. You have to empathize with
Donald Trump, the human being, and from that perspective,
ask him hard questions. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
So who do you think is the counterpoint
if you're going to seek balance in your guests. If you're going
to have Trump on, then you have to have who on? LEX FRIDMAN: Well,
that's interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Anthony Fauci seems to be strongly associated
with counter values, at least in the eye of the public. I think he's retiring soon, but. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
he's retiring. So that's really
interesting, Anthony Fauci. Yeah, definitely, but I don't
think he's a counterbalance. He's a complicated,
fascinating figure who seems to have attracted
a lot of hate and distrust, but also-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
love from some people. LEX FRIDMAN: And love. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
love from some people. I mean, I know people, not
even necessarily scientists, who have pro-Fauci shirts. I've seen people with anti-Fauci
shirts, excuse me, certainly, but who adore him. There are people who adore
him in the same way there are people that adore Trump. It's so interesting that
one species of animal you get such divergent
neural circuitry. LEX FRIDMAN: It
almost feels like it's by design and every single topic
we find tension and division is fascinating to watch. I mean, I got to really witness
it from zero to a hundred in Ukraine, where there is
not huge significant division. There was in certain parts of
Ukraine, but across Europe, across the world there
was not that much division between Russia and Ukraine,
and it was just born overnight, this intense hatred. You see the same kind of stuff
with Fauci over the pandemic. At first we were all
huddled in uncertainty. There is a togetherness
with the pandemic. Of course, there
is more difficult because you're isolated. But then you start
to figure out-- probably the politicians and
the media try to figure out, how can I take a side
here and how can I now start reporting on
this side or that side and say how the
other side is wrong? And so I think Anthony Fauci
is a part of just being used as a scapegoat
for certain things as part of that kind of
narrative of division. But I think-- so Trump is
a singular figure that, to me, represents something
important in American history. I'm not sure what
that is, but I think you have to think-- you
put on your historian hat, go forward in time,
and think back. How will he be remembered 20,
30, 40, 50 years from now? Who is the opposite of that? You have to-- I would really have
to think about that because Trump was so singular. I think AOC is an
interesting one, but she's so young it's
unclear to know how-- if she represents a legitimately
large scale movement or not. Bernie Sanders is an
interesting option, but I wish he would be
30, 40 years younger. The young Bernie
would be a good-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: There are
scientists working on that. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, I think so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Not
him specifically, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah. Maybe him. We never know. There is a big conspiracy
theory that Putin is-- that that's a body double. It's no longer him. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Bernie is Putin? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no, no, no. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm having a
hard time merging that image. LEX FRIDMAN: The conspiracy
theory is-- no, no, no. That the Putin we see on
camera today is a body double. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
one thing that in science, and in particular,
in anatomy, there's a classification scheme for
different types of anatomists, which they either say you're
a lumper or a splitter. Some people like to call a
whole structure something, not necessarily
just for simplicity but for a lot of reasons. And then other people like
to microdivide the nucleus into multiple names. And of course, people used to
be able to name different brain structures after themselves. So that would be the nucleus of
Lex and the Huberman vesiculus or whatever. Less of that nowadays. And by the way, those structures
don't actually exist just yet. We haven't defined those yet. I was making those names up. But what's interesting is it
seems like in the last five years, there's been
a lot of trend-- there's been a trend, excuse
me, toward a requirement for lumping. You can't say-- it seems that
it's not allowed, if you will, to say, hey, yeah, you know-- and here I'm not stating my-- I will never reveal
my preferences about pandemic related things
for hopefully obvious reasons. Some people will say
vaccines, yes, but masks, no. Or vaccines and masks,
yes, but let people work. And other people will say,
no, everyone stay home. And then other people will
say, no, no vaccines, no masks. Let everybody work. No one was saying no vaccines,
no masks, and stay home, I don't think. So there's this sort
of lumping, right? The boundaries around
ideology really did start to defy science. I mean, it wasn't scientific. It was one part science-ish
at times and sometimes really hardcore science. Other times it was
politics, economics. I mean, we really
saw the confluence of all these different
domains of society that use very different
criteria to evaluate the world. I mean, as a
scientist, I remember when the vaccines
first came out and I asked somebody, one
of the early concerns I had that was actually
satisfied for me was, how does this thing turn off? If you start generating
mRNA, how does it actually get turned off? So I asked a friend, they
know a lot about RNA biology. And I said, you know,
how does it turn off? They explained it to me and
I was like, OK, makes sense. I asked some other questions. But most people aren't
going to think about it at that level of
detail necessarily, but it did seem
that there was just kind of amorphous
blobs of ideology that they grabbed on
to things and then there was this need for
a chasm between them. It was almost felt like it
became illegal, in some ways, to want two of the things from
that menu and one of the things from that menu. I really felt like I
was being constrained by a kind of like
Bento box model where I didn't get to define
what was in the Bento box. I could either have Bento
box A or Bento box Z, but nothing in between. LEX FRIDMAN: And I
think on that topic and I think a lot of
topics, most people are in the middle with
humility, uncertainty, and they're just kind of
trying to figure it out. And I think there is just
the extremes defining the nature of this division. So I think it's the
role of a lot of us in our individual
lives, and also if you have a
platform of any kind, I think you have to try to walk
in the middle with the empathy and humility. And that's actually what science
is about is the humility. I'm still thinking about
who's the opposite of Trump. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
maybe there is none. I mean, maybe Fauci is
orthogonal to Trump. I mean, not everything
has an opposite. I mean, maybe he's
an n of 1 maybe he's in the minority
of one because he was an outsider from Washington
who then made it there. LEX FRIDMAN: But also I wonder-- you have to pick your battles
because every battle you fight you should take very seriously. And just the amount
of hate I get, I got, and I still get
for having sat down with the Pfizer CEO, that was
a very valuable lesson for me. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, that
one got you a lot of heat? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, it
still does because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Because you
had some pretty controversial guests on from time to time. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, that one-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is he
still the Pfizer CEO? LEX FRIDMAN: I believe so. ANDREW HUBERMAN: CEOs
turn over like crazy. This is the thing
I didn't realize. In science if somebody moves
institutions it's a big deal. Most people don't have more
than two moves in their career, maybe. But they often move to the
next building is a big deal. But it in biotech-- it's like have a former
colleague of mine from San Diego and
he's been a CEO here, then he's a CEO there. He went back to a company
he was a CEO before. He's probably back
at the university we worked at for all I know. It's amazing how much
moving around there. It is a very
itinerant profession. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah,
I think they're-- in certain companies, I guess
in biotech would be the case, the CEO is more of like a
manager type so you can-- jumping around benefits
your experience so you become better and
better being a manager. There's some leader
revolutionary CEOs that stick around for
longer because they're so critical to
pivoting a company, like the Microsoft
CEO currently. Sundar Pichai is
somebody like that. Obviously, Elon Musk is
somebody like that that is part of pivoting a company
into new domains constantly, but yeah. In biotech there's a machine. In the eyes of a lot of people,
big pharma is like big tobacco. It's the epitome of everything
that is wrong with capitalism. It's evil, right? And so I showed up
in the conversation where I thought with
a pretty open mind and really asked what I
thought were difficult questions of him. I don't think he's ever sat
down to a grilling of that kind. In fact, I'm pretty sure
they cut the interview short because of that, and
I thought literally it was hot in the room
and we're sweating and I was asking
tough questions. For somebody that half the
country or a large percent of the country believes he's
alleviated a lot of-- he helped, through the financial
resources that Pfizer has, helped alleviate a lot of
suffering in the world. And so I thought for
somebody like that, I was asking pretty
hard questions. Boy, did I get to
hear from the side-- usually one of the sides is
more intense in their anger. So there are certain
political topics-- like with Andrew
Tate, for example, I would hear from a very-- it would probably be
the left, far left, that would write very angrily. And so that's a group
you'll hear from. The Pfizer CEO, I didn't
get almost any messages from people saying, why
did you go so hard on him? He's an incredible human,
incredible leader and CEO of a company that helped
us with the vaccine that nobody thought would be
possible to develop so quickly. ANDREW HUBERMAN: You did not
get letters of that sort? LEX FRIDMAN: I did not. I mean, here and there,
but the sea of people that said everything
from me being weak that I wasn't able
to call out this person, how do you sit down, how do
you platform this evil person, how do you make him look
human, all that kind of stuff. And you have to deal with that. You have to-- of
course, it's great. It's great because I have to
do some soul searching, which is like, did I? You have to ask
some hard questions. I love criticism like that. You get to-- I had some low points. There's definitely some despair
and you start to wonder, was I too weak? Should I have talked to him? What is true? And you sit there alone
and just marinate in that. Hopefully over time
that makes you better, but I still don't know what the
right answer with that one is. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I feel
that money plays a role here. When people think
big pharma, they think billions of dollars-- maybe even trillions
of dollars, really. And certainly people who make a
lot of money get scrutiny that others don't. Part of it is that they are
often not always visible, but I think that there is
a natural and reflexive-- and I'm not justifying it. I certainly don't
feel this because I know some people who
are very wealthy, some people who are very poor. I can't say it scales
with happiness at all. People are always
shocked to hear that, but that's what I've observed
in very wealthy people. But that people who
have a lot of money are often held to a
different standard because people resent
that, some people resent that, and maybe there are
other reasons as well. I mean, among people
who are very wealthy, oftentimes the wish
is for status, right? Not money. You get a bunch of
billionaires in a room, and unless one of
them is Elon, who also has immense status
for his accomplishments, typically if you put a
Nobel Prize winner in a room with a bunch of
billionaires they're all talking to that person. Right? And there are many very
interesting billionaires. But status is something that is
often but not always associated with money, but is a much
rarer form of uniqueness out there, a
positive uniqueness-- if one considers status positive
because there's a downside to. So I wonder whether or not the
Pfizer CEO caught extra heat because people
assume, and I probably assume also, that his
salary is quite immense. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. So because I have a
lot of data on this. I can answer it. It's a very good hypothesis. Let's test that scientifically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's about to
tell me it's a great hypothesis but it's wrong. I know the smirk. I know the smirk. LEX FRIDMAN: I honestly
think it's wrong. That effect is there
for a lot of people, but I think the distrust
is not towards the CEO. The distrust is
towards the company. One of the really
difficult soul searching I had to do, which is just having
to interact with Pfizer folks at every level, from
junior to the CEO, they're all really nice people. They have a mission. They talk about trying
to really help people because that's the
best way to make money is to come
up with medicine that helps a lot of people. The mission is clear. They're all good people, a lot
of really brilliant people, PhDs. So you can have a system
where all the people are good, including the CEO. And by good, I mean
people that really are trying to do everything. They dedicate their
whole life to do good. And yet, you have to think
that that system can deviate from a path that does good
because you start to deceive yourself of what is good,
you turn it into a game where money does come into
play from a company perspective where you convince yourself
the more money you make, the more good you'll
be able to do. And then you start to focus
more and more and more on making more money, and then
you can really deviate and lose track of what is actually good. I'm not saying necessarily
Pfizer does that, but I think companies
could do that. You can apply that criticism
to social media companies, to big pharma companies. One of the big lessons for me-- I don't know what the answer
is, but that all the people inside the company
can be good, people you would want to
hang out with, people you would want to work with,
but as a company is doing evil. That's a possibility. So the distrust I don't think
is towards the billionaire individual, which I do
see a lot of in this case. I think it's Wall
Street distrust, that the machinery of this
particular organization has gone off track. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It's the
generalization of hate again. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. And then good luck
figuring out what is true. This is the tough stuff. But I should say
the individuals-- individual scientists
at the NIH and Pfizer are just incredible people. They're really brilliant people. I never trust the administration
or the business people-- no offense, business people. But the scientists
are always good. They have the right
motivator in life. But again, they can
have blinders on. Too focused on the science. Nazi Germany has a
history of people just too focused on
the science and then the politicians use the
scientists to achieve whatever end they want. But if you just look narrowly
at the journey of a scientist, it's a beautiful one
because they're ultimately in it for the
curiosity, the moment of discovery versus money. I mean, prestige probably does
come into play later in life, but especially young scientists. They're after the--
it's like they're pulling at the
threat of curiosity to try to discover
something big. They get excited by
that kind of stuff, and it's beautiful to see. ANDREW HUBERMAN: It
is beautiful see. I have a former
graduate student, now a postdoc at
Caltech, and I don't even know she had a cell phone. She would come in the lab, put
her cell phone into the desk, and she was
tremendously productive. But that wasn't why
I brought it up. She was productive as a side
effect of just being absolutely committed and
obsessed to discover the answers to the
questions she was asking as best she could, and
it was-- you could feel it. You could just feel the
intensity, and just incredibly low activation energy. If there was an experiment to
do she would just go do it. You're teaching at MIT. You are obviously
traveling the world, you're right on the podcast
a lot of coverage of chess recently, which is interesting. I don't play chess but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, I have
some scientific questions to you about that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, OK. Sure. Let's get to those for sure. And then-- LEX FRIDMAN: You're
not going to like it. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. OK. And then also some very-- do I have to spell
Massachusetts again? LEX FRIDMAN: Of course. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Also you still seem to have a proclivity for finding
guests that are controversial, right? You're thinking about Tate,
we're talking about Trump, we're talking about the Pfizer
CEO, we're talking about Fauci. These are intense people. And so what we're
getting folks is a-- we're not doing
neuroimaging here in the traditional sense of
putting someone into a scanner. What we're doing
here is we're using, as the great Karl Deisseroth,
who was on your podcast-- LEX FRIDMAN: Thank you for that. Thank you for connecting us. He's an incredible person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's an
incredible psychiatrist, bioengineer, and human
being and writer, and your conversation
with him was phenomenal. I listened to it twice. I actually have taken notes. We talk about it
in this household. We really do. His description of
love is not to be missed, I'll just
leave it at that, because if I try and say
it I won't capture it well. But we're getting
a language based map of at least a portion
of Lex Fridman's brain here. So what else is going on
these days in that brain as it relates to robotics, AI? Our last conversation
was a lot about robots and the potential for
robot-human interaction. Even what is a robot, et cetera. Are you still working on robots
or focused on robots, and where is science showing up in your
life besides the things we've already talked about? LEX FRIDMAN: So I
think the last time we talked was before Ukraine. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes. You were just about to leave. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. I mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: So
that's why I went on. I was like, you
know, this might be the last-- you said you
wanted to come out here before or after. I was like, come
out there before. I want to see you before you go. But here you are in the flesh. LEX FRIDMAN: So a lot of-- just a lot of my mind has
been occupied, obviously, with that part of the world. But most of the
difficult struggles that I'm still going through
is that I haven't launched the company that
I want to launch and the company
has to do with AI. I mean, it's maybe a
longer conversation, but the ultimate dream is
to put robots in every home. But short term I see
there a possibility of launching a
social media company, and it's a nontrivial
explanation why that leads to robots in the home. But it's basically
the algorithms that fuel effective
social robotics, so robots that you can form
a deep connection with. And so I've been really-- yeah,
I've been building prototypes but struggling that
I don't have maybe, if I were to be critical,
the guts to launch a company. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Or the time. LEX FRIDMAN: Well,
it's combined. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think
you've got the guts. I mean, it's clear if you'll
do an interview with the Pfizer CEO and you're considering
putting this Tate fellow on your podcast and
you've gone to the Ukraine that you have the guts. It means not doing quite
a lot of other things. LEX FRIDMAN: That's what I mean. It does take-- the thing
is, as many people know, when you fill your
day and you're busy, that busyness becomes an excuse
that you use against doing the things that scare you. A lot of people use
family in this way. You know, my wife,
my kids, I can't. When in reality some of the most
successful people have a wife and have kids and have
families and they still do it. And so a lot of times we can
fill the day with busy work, with-- yeah, of course, I have podcasts
and all this kind of stuff. And they make me happy and
they're all-- they're wonderful and there's research,
there's teaching, and so on. But all of that can just serve
as an excuse from the thing that my heart says is
the right thing to do, and that's why I don't
have the guts, the guts to say no to
basically everything and then to focus all out. Because part of it is
I'm unlikely to fail at anything in my life
currently because I've already found a comfortable place. With a startup it's
mostly going to be-- most likely going to
be a failure, if not an embarrassing failure. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
the machine learning data that I'm aware of-- I don't know a lot
about machine learning, but within the realm
of neuroscience, say that a failure
rate of about 15% is optimal for
neuroplasticity and growth. Whether or not that translates
to all kinds of practices isn't clear, but getting
trials right 85% of the time seems to be optimal
for language learning, seems to be optimal
for mathematics, and it seems to be optimal
for physical pursuits on average, right? I'm sure I'm going-- you have more machine
learning geeks that listen to your podcast
than listen to this podcast, but it doesn't mean you have
to fail on 15% of your weight sets, folks. I mean, it could be 16%. No, I'm just kidding. It's not exact, but it's a
pretty good rule of thumb. LEX FRIDMAN: I think a
lot of startup founders would literally murder
for 85% chance of success. I think given all the
opportunities I have, the skill set, the funding,
all that kind of stuff, my chances are relatively
high for success. But what relatively high
means in the startup world is still far, far below 85. You're talking about
single digit percentages. Most startups fail. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
I think it means-- the decision to focus on the
company and not on other things means the decision to close
the hatch on dopamine retrieval from all these other things that
are very predictable sources of dopamine. Not that everything is
dopamine, but dopamine is, I think, the primary
chemical driver of motivation. If you know that you can get
some degree of satisfaction from scrolling social media
or from that particular cup of coffee, that's what
you're going to do. That's what you're going to
consume unless you somehow invert the algorithm
and you say, it's actually my
denial of myself drinking that coffee that's
going to be the dopamine. Right? LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, interesting. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
that's the beauty of having a forebrain is that
you can make those decisions. This is the essence,
I do believe, of what we see of David Goggins. There's much more there. There's a person that none
of us know and only he knows, of course. But the idea that the pain
is the source of dopamine. The limbic friction, as I
sometimes like to call it, is the source of dopamine. That runs counter to how
most nervous systems work, but it's decision based, right? It's not because his
musculature is a certain way or he had CRISPR or something. It's because he decides that. And I think that's
amazing, but what it means in terms of
starting a company and changing priorities is
a closing the hatch on all or many of the current
sources of dopamine so that you can derive
dopamine from the failures within this narrow
context, and there's a very reductionist view
and neurocentric view of what we're talking about. But I think about this a lot. I mean, the decision to choose
one relationship versus another is a decision to close down
other opportunities, right? So I think that the
decision to order one thing off the menu versus others
is the decision to close down those other hatches. So I think that you
absolutely can do it. It's just a question of,
can you flip the algorithm? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Remap the source of
dopamine to something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Right. And maybe go out there
not to succeed but make the-- the journey is the
destination type thing, but when you're financially
vested in your time-- and as far as I
know, we only get one life, at least
on this planet and you want to spend
that wisely, right? LEX FRIDMAN: And a lot of the
people that surround you-- people are really
important, and I don't have people around me that
say you should do a start up. It's very difficult to
find such people because-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Is Austin
big startup culture right now? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, it is. It is. But it doesn't make sense
for me to do a startup. This is what the people
that love me my whole life have been telling me,
it doesn't make sense what you're doing right now. Just do the thing you
were doing previously. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Why
do I get the sense that because they
are saying this you're apt to go against them? LEX FRIDMAN: No. Actually, I was never
that, unfortunately. Unfortunately, I need-- I've talked to people I love,
my parents, family, and so on, friends. I'm one of those people that
needs unconditional support for difficult things. I know myself coaching
wise is good-- so here's how I
get coached best. Let's say wrestling. I like a coach that says,
you want to win the Olympics? They will not-- if
I say I want to win the gold medal at the
Olympics in freestyle wrestling I want a coach that
doesn't blink once and hears me and believes that I
can do it, and then is viciously intense and
cruel to me on that pursuit. If you want to do
this, let's do this. Right? But that's support. That positivity, I don't-- I'm never-- I'm not energized,
nor do I see that as love, a person saying-- basically criticizing that. Saying, you're too old to win
the Olympic gold medal, right? Or all the things
you can come up with. That's not helpful to me
and I can't find a dopamine, or I haven't yet, a dopamine
source from the haters. Basically people that are
criticizing you, trying to prove them wrong. It never got me off. It never-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Whereas some
people seem to like that. I mean, David Goggins
seems to come to mind. He seems driven by many sources. He has access-- I don't know because
I've never asked him, but if I were to
venture a guess, I'd say that he probably
has a lot of options inside his head as how to
push through challenge. Not just overcome pain,
but he'll post sometimes about the fact that
people will say this or people will do this
and talk about the pushback approach. He'll also talk
about the pushback approach that's purely
internal that doesn't involve anyone else. Great versatility there. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. There's literally
like a voice he yells that represents
some kind of devil that wants him to fail,
and he calls them bitch and all kinds of things
saying, you know, fuck you. I'm not. There's always an enemy and
he's going against that enemy. I mean, I wish-- maybe that's something. I mean, it's really interesting. Maybe you can remap it this
way so that you can construct-- that's a kind of
obvious mechanism. Construct an amorphous
blob that is a hater that wants you to fail, right? That's kind of the
David Goggins thing. And that blob says you're
too weak, you're too dumb, you're too old,
you're too fat, you're too whatever, and getting you
to want to quit and so on. And then you start getting
angry at that blob, and maybe that's
a good motivator. I haven't personally
really tried that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I've
had external challenge when I was a postdoc, very
prominent laboratory-- several prominent
laboratories, in fact, were working on the
same thing that I was, and I was just
this lowly postdoc working on a project
pretty independent from the lab I was in. And there was
competition but there was plenty of room for everybody
to win, but in my head-- and frankly, I won't
disclose who this is. And because there was some
legitimate competition there and a little bit of
friction-- not too much, healthy scientific friction-- yeah, I might have pushed
a few extra hours or more, a little bit. I have to say, it
felt metabolizing. It felt catabolic, right? I couldn't be sustained by it. And I contrast that with
the podcast or the work that my laboratory
is doing now focused on stress and human performance,
et cetera, and it's pure love. It's pure curiosity and love. I mean, there are hard
days, but I never-- there's no adversary in the picture. They're the practical
workings of life that-- LEX FRIDMAN: That was the thing
that Joe really inspired me on, and people do create
adversarial relationships in podcasting because you get-- YouTubers do this. They hate seeing somebody
else be successful. There's a feeling of
jealousy, and some people even see that as healthy. Mr. Beast is somebody, some
of these popular YouTubers, how do they get 100 million
views and I only get 20 views? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Mr.
Beast devoted his entire-- according to him,
his entire life he's been focused on becoming
this massive YouTube channel. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that,
he's inspiring in many ways, but there's some
people that become famous for doing much less
insane pursuit of greatness than Mr. Beast. People become famous and
on social media and so on, and it's easy to
be jealous of them. One of the early things
I've learned from Joe just being a fan of his
podcast is how much he celebrated everybody. And again, maybe I ruined
my whole dopamine thing but I don't get energized by
people that become popular. In the podcasting
space and YouTube, it doesn't-- it's awesome. All of it is awesome and
I'm inspired by that. But the problem is that's
not a good motivator. Inspiration is like, oh,
cool, humans can do this. This is beautiful. But it's not-- I'm looking. I'm looking for a
forcing function. That's why I gave away
the salary from MIT. I was hoping my bank
account had zero. That would be a forcing
function to be like, oh shit. You know? And you're not allowed
to have a normal job, so I wanted to launch-- and then the podcast
becomes a source of income. So it's like, goddammit. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. Yeah. Well, and here I have
to confess my biases. You are so good at what you
do in the realm of podcast-- and you're excellent at
other things as well, I just have less
experience in those things. I know here I'm taking
the liberty of speaking for many, many people
in just saying, I sure as hell hope you
don't shut down the podcast. But as your friend
and as somebody who cares very deeply about
your happiness and your deeper satisfaction, if it's
in your heart's heart to do a company, well then,
damn it, do the company. LEX FRIDMAN: And a lot
of it I wouldn't even categorize as happiness. I don't know if you have
things like that in your life, but I'm probably the happiest
I could possibly be right now. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That's wonderful. LEX FRIDMAN: But
the thing is there's a longing for the
start up that has nothing to do with happiness. It's something else. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That's that itch. That's that itch. LEX FRIDMAN: I'm pretty sure
I'll be less happy because it's a really tough process. I mean, to whatever degree
you can extract happiness from struggle, yes, maybe. But I don't see it. I think I'll have some
very, very low points. There's a lot of people
who find companies-- found companies know about. And I also want to
be in a relationship, I want to get married,
and sure as hell a startup is not
going to increase the likelihood of that. ANDREW HUBERMAN: We
could start up a family and start a company. LEX FRIDMAN: Well, that's a-- I'm a huge believer
in that, which is get in a relationship
at a low point in your life, which is-- [LAUGHTER] ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sorry. I'm not disputing your stance,
nor am I agreeing with it. It's just every once
in a while there's a Lex Fridmanism that hits a
particular circuit in my brain. I have to just laugh out loud. LEX FRIDMAN: I just
think that it's easy to have a relationship
when everything is good. The relationships that become
strong and are tested quickly are the ones when
shit is going down. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, then
there's hope for me yet. Before we sat down I was
having a conversation with my podcast
producer, who is a-- I wouldn't say avid, rather he's
a rabid consumer of podcasts and finds these amazing
podcasts, small podcasts and unique episodes. Anyway, we were talking
about some stuff that he had seen and read
in the business sector, and he was talking about
the difference between job, career, and a calling, right? And I think he was
extracting this from conversations of CEOs
and founders, et cetera. I forget the specific
founders that brought this to light for him. But that this idea that
if you focus on a job you can make an income, and
hopefully you enjoy your job or not hate it too much. A career represents a
sort of, in my mind, a kind of series of
evolutions that one can go through-- junior
professor, tenure, et cetera. But a calling has a whole
other level of energetic pull to it because it
includes career and job and it includes this
concept of a life. It's very hard to draw the line
between a calling in career and a calling in the
other parts of your life. So the question,
therefore, is, do you feel a calling
to start this company or is it more of a compulsion
that irritates you? Is it something you
wish would go away or is it something that
you hope won't go away? LEX FRIDMAN: No, I
hope it won't go away. It's a calling. It's a calling. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
That's beautiful. LEX FRIDMAN: It's like
when I see a robot-- when I first
interacted with robots, and it became even stronger the
more sophisticated the robots I interacted, with
I see a magic there. And you're like,
you look around, does anyone else see this magic? It's kind of like maybe
when you fall in love, like that feeling. Does anyone else
notice this person that just walked in the room? I feel that way
about robots, and I can elaborate what that
means but I'm not even sure I can convert it into words. I just feel like the
social integration of robots in society will create
a really interesting world. And our ability to
anthropomorphize when we look at a robot and
our ability to feel things when we look at a robot is
something that most of us don't yet experience,
but I think everybody will experience
in the next few decades. And I just want to be
a part of exploring that because it hasn't been
really thoroughly explored. The best roboticists
in the world are not currently working
on that problem at all. They try to avoid human
beings completely, and nobody's really
working that problem in terms of when you
look at the numbers. All the big tech companies
that are investing money, the closest thing
to that is Alexa and basically being a servant
to help tell you the weather or play music and so on. It's not trying to
form a deep connection. And so sometimes you
just notice the thing. Not only do I notice the magic. There's a gut
feeling, which I try not to speak to because
there's no track record, but I feel like I can be good
at bringing that magic out of the robot. And there's no data that
says I would be good at that, but there's a feeling. It's just a feeling. Because I've done
so many things-- I love doing playing guitar,
all that kind of stuff, jujitsu. I've never felt that feeling. When I'm doing
jujitsu I don't feel the magic of the genius
required to be extremely good. At guitar I don't
feel any of that. But I've noticed that in
others, great musicians, they notice the magic
about the thing they do and they ran with it. And I just always thought-- I think it had a different
form before I knew robots existed, before I existed. The form was more about
the magic between humans. I think of it as love, but
the smile that two friends have towards each other
when I was really young. And people would be excited
when they first know each other and notice each other,
and there's that moment that they share that
feeling together. I was like, wow, that's
really interesting. It is really interesting
that these two separate intelligent
organisms are able to connect all of a sudden
on this deep emotional level. It's like, huh. It's just beautiful to see,
and I notice the magic of that. And then when I started a
programming-- programming, period, but then programming
AI systems, you realize, oh, that could be-- that's not just between
humans and humans. That could be humans and
other entities, dogs, cats, and robots. And so I-- for some reason
it hit me the most intensely when I saw robots. So yeah, it's a calling. But it's a calling that I can
just enjoy the vision of it, the vision of a future world, of
an exciting future world that's full of cool stuff, or I can
be part of building that. And being part of
building that means doing the hard work
of capitalism, which is like raising funds from
people, which for me, right now, is the easy part, and
then hiring a lot of people. I don't know how much you know
about hiring, but hiring-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hiring
excellent people. LEX FRIDMAN:
Excellent people that will define the
trajectory of not only your company, but your whole
existence as a human being. And building it up, not
failing them because now they all depend on you,
and not failing the world with an opportunity
to bring something that brings joy to people. And all of that
pressure, just non-stop fires that you have to put out. The drama, the having
to work with people you've never worked with like
lawyers and human resources and supply chain. And because this is
very compute heavy, the computer infrastructure,
managing security, cybersecurity, because you're
dealing with people's data. So now you have to understand
not only the cybersecurity of data and the privacy, how
to maintain privacy correctly with data, but also the
psychology of people trusting you with their data. And how, if you look at Mark
Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey and those folks,
they seem to be hated by a large number of people. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Jack seemed-- I didn't-- LEX FRIDMAN: Much less so, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I think I
always think of Jack as a loved individual, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: Well, yeah, you
have a very positive view of the world, yes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I like Jack a
lot and I like his mind and I-- someone close to him
described him to me recently as he's an
excellent listener. That's what they
said about Jack, and that's my
experience of him too. Very private person so
we'll leave it at that. But listen, I think
Jack Dorsey is one of the greats of
the last 200 years and is just much quieter
about his stance on things than a lot of people. But much of what we see in
the world that's wonderful, I think we owe him
a debt of gratitude. I'm just voicing my
stance here, but-- LEX FRIDMAN: And the person. This is really important. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: A wonderful
person, a brilliant person, a good person,
but you still have to pay the price of making
any kind of mistakes as the head of a company. You don't get any extra bonus
points for being a good person. ANDREW HUBERMAN: But his
willingness to go on Rogan and deal directly and say,
I don't know an answer to that in some cases. But to deal directly with some
really challenging questions to me earned him
tremendous respect. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. As an individual. He was still part of him-- you've said-- OK,
and I love Jack too, and I interact with him often. ANDREW HUBERMAN: He's
been on your podcast. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes. But he's also part of a
system, as we talked about, and I would argue that Jack
shouldn't have brought anyone else with him on that podcast. If you go-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Oh, that's right. He had a cadre of-- LEX FRIDMAN: Oh, he had I
guess the head legal with him. And also it requires a
tremendous amount of skill to go on a podcast
like Joe Rogan and be able to win over
the trust of people by being able to be
transparent and communicate how the company really works
because the more you reveal about how a social
media company works, the more you open
up for security, the vector of attacks increases. Also, there's a lot of
difficult decisions in terms of censorship and
not that are made that if you make
them transparent you're going to get an order
of magnitude more hate. So you have to make all
those kinds of decisions, and I think that's one of
the things I have to realize is you have to take that
avalanche of potentially hate if you make mistakes. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, you
have a very clear picture of this architecture
of what's required in order to create a company. Of course, there's
division of labor too. I mean, you don't have to do
all of those things in detail, but finding people that
are excellent to do-- to run the critical
segments is obviously key. I'll just say what
I said earlier, which is if it's in your heart's
heart to start a company, if that, indeed,
is your calling, and it sounds like it
is, then I can't wait. LEX FRIDMAN: Does the
heart have a heart? I don't know. What's that
expression even mean? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Probably not. LEX FRIDMAN: We
romanticize the heart. ANDREW HUBERMAN: In my lab
at one point, early days we worked on cuttlefish, and
they have multiple hearts, but they pump green
blood, believe it or not. Very fascinating animal. Speaking of hearts
and green blood, earlier today
before we sat down I solicited four questions on
Instagram in a brief post. LEX FRIDMAN: Do you want to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: If you'll-- LEX FRIDMAN: --look
at some of them? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, let's
take these in real time. My podcast team is always
teasing me that I never have any charge on my phone. I'm one of these people that
likes to run in the yellow, or whatever it is. LEX FRIDMAN: An iPhone? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: It's funny
how always the iPhone people are out of battery. It's weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
I just got a new one. LEX FRIDMAN: So weird. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean, this
one has plenty of battery. I just got a new one so
I have different numbers for different things,
personal and work, et cetera. I'm trying that now. All right. Get into the-- LEX FRIDMAN: I have a chess
thing too to mention to you. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Oh, yes, please. Will I insult you if I look up
these questions as you ask me? LEX FRIDMAN: No, no. But I will insult you by asking
you this question because I think it's hilarious. So there's been a controversy
about cheating where Hans Niemann, who
is a 2,700 player-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, yeah. LEX FRIDMAN: --was
accused of cheating. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I saw that
clip on your clips channel. By the way, I love
your clips channel, but I listen to
your full channel. LEX FRIDMAN: The big accusation
is that he cheated by having-- I mean, it's half
joke but it's starting getting me to wonder whether-- so that you can cheat by having
vibrating anal beads so you can send messages to-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, let's
rephrase that statement. Not you can, but one can. LEX FRIDMAN: One can. One can. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Yeah, thank you. LEX FRIDMAN: That was
a personal attack, yes. But it made me realize, I mean-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm just going
to adjust myself in my seat here. LEX FRIDMAN: I use
it all the time for podcasting to
send myself messages to remind myself of notes. But it's interesting. I mean, it-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm not
going to call you again. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, that's
exactly where I keep my phone. It did get me down this
whole rabbit hole of, well, how would you be able to
send communication in order to cheat in different sports? I mean, that doesn't even have
to do with chess in particular, but it's interesting
in chess and poker that there's mechanisms
modern day where you're streaming live
the competition so people can watch it on TV. If they can only send
you a signal back, they-- it's just a fun little
thing to think about and if it's possible
to pull off. So I wanted to get your
scientific evaluation of that-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: To
cheat using some sort of interoceptive device? LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah. Vibrating of some kind. Yeah. Or no, no. That's one way to send
signals is, like, Morse code, basically. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. So there's a famous-- I believe there's
a famous real world story of physics students-- I'm going to get
some of this wrong so I'm saying this in
kind of coarse form so that somebody
will correct this. But I believe it was physics
graduate students from UC Santa Cruz or somewhere else,
maybe it was Caltech-- a bunch of universities
so that no one associates it with any one university
that went to Vegas and used some sort of tactile
device for card counting thing. This was actually
demonstrated also-- not this particular
incident, I don't think-- in the movie Casino
where they spotted a-- I remember Robert
De Niro, who you have a not so vague resemblance
to, by the way, in Taxi Driver. LEX FRIDMAN: God, I wish I had
a De Niro impression right now. Travis Bickle. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Look it up, folks. Travis Bickle is if Lex ever
shaved his head into a Mohawk. LEX FRIDMAN: I would. ANDREW HUBERMAN: So he had a
tapping device on his ankle that was signaling. Someone else was counting
cards and then signaling to that person. So yeah, that could be
done in the tactile way. It could be done,
obviously, earpieces if it's deep earpiece. I think there are ways
that they look for that. Certainly any kind
of vibrational device in whatever orifice provided
someone could pay attention to that while still
playing the game. Yeah, I think it's
entirely possible. Now, could it be
done purely neurally? Could there be
something that was-- and listen, it wouldn't have
to even be below the skull. This is where whenever people
hear about Neuralink or brain machine interface
they always think, oh, you have to drill
down below the skull and put a chip below
into the skull. I think there are people
walking around nowadays with glucose monitoring devices,
like Levels-- which I've used and it was very informative
for me, actually, as a kind of an experiment. Gave me a lot of interesting
insights about my blood sugar regulation, how it reacts to
different foods, et cetera. Well, you can implant
a tactile device below the skin with
a simple incision. Actually, one of the
neurosurgeons at Neuralink I know well because he
came up at some point through my laboratory
and was at Stanford, and he actually has put in a
radio receiver in his hand, and his wife has it too. And he can open locks
of his house and things like that, so he's been doing-- LEX FRIDMAN: Under the skin? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Under the skin. You can go to-- LEX FRIDMAN: How does that work? So how do you use-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: A piercer. You go to a body
piercer type person and they can just
slide it under there, and it's got a battery
life of something and some fairly long duration. LEX FRIDMAN: How do you
experience the tactile-- the haptics of it? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, no. That just allows him to
open certain locks with just his hand, but you could easily
put some sort of tactile device in there. LEX FRIDMAN: But does it
have to connect to the nerves or is it just like--
just vibration? ANDREW HUBERMAN:
No, just vibration. LEX FRIDMAN: And
you can probably sense it even if it's
under the skin, I wonder. ANDREW HUBERMAN: And
it can be by-- it can be Bluetooth linked. I mean, I've seen--
there's an Engineering Laboratory at the University
of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, that's got an amazing
device which is about the size of a Band-Aid. It goes on the
clavicles and it uses sound waves pinged into the
body to measure cavitation. Think about this for a moment. This is being used in
the military where, let's say, you're leading
an operation or something. People are getting shot,
shot at, and on a laptop you can see where the
bullet entry points are. Are people dead? Are they bleeding out? Entry, exit points. You can get-- take it out
of the battlefield scenario. You can get breathing, body
position 24 hours a day. There's so much that you can
do looking at cavitation. So these same sorts of
devices on 12 hour Bluetooth could be used to send
all sorts of signals. Maybe every time you're
supposed to hold your hand-- I'm not a good gambler
so I only play roulette when I go to Vegas because
you just long, boring games, but you get some good mileage
out of each out of each run, usually. But maybe every time
you're supposed to hold, the person gets a
stomach cinching because this is stimulating
the vagus a little bit and they get a little
bit of an ache. So it doesn't have
to be Morse code. It can be yes, no, maybe. Right? It can be green, red,
yellow type signaling. It doesn't have to be very
sophisticated to give somebody a significant advantage. Anyway, I haven't thought
about this in detail before this conversation
but, oh, yeah, there's an immense landscape. LEX FRIDMAN: I don't
know if you know a poker player named Phil Ivey? ANDREW HUBERMAN: No, I don't
follow the gambling thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Well,
he's considered to be one of the
greatest poker players of all time legitimately. He's just incredibly good. But he got-- there's
this big case where he was accused of
cheating and prove-- and it's not really
cheating, which is what's really fascinating. Is it turns out-- so he plays poker. Texas Hold'em, mostly,
but all kinds of poker. It turns out that the grid
on the back of the cards is often printed a
little bit imperfectly, and so you can use the
asymmetry of the imperfections to try to figure
out certain cards. So if you play and you remember
that a certain card is, like-- I think the 8 in that deck that
he was accused of-- an 8 and 9 were slightly different
symmetry wise. So he can now ask
the dealer actually to rotate it to
check the symmetry. So you would ask the dealer
to rotate the card to see that there's-- to detect the
asymmetry of the back of the card, and now he
knows which cards are 8's and 9's or likelier to be
8's and 9's, and he was using that information to play
poker and win a lot of money. But it's just a
slight advantage. And his case is-- and
in fact, the judge found this, that he's
not actually cheating, but it's not right. You can't use this kind
of extra information. So it's fascinating that you
can discover these little holes in games if you pay
close enough attention. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah. It's fascinating. And I think that I
did watch that clip about the potential of a
cheating event in chess, and the fact that a
number of chess players admit to cheating at some
point in their career. Very, very interesting. LEX FRIDMAN: Well,
it was online. So online cheating
is easier, right? When you're playing
online cheating in a game where the machine
is much better than the human, it's very difficult to
prove that you're human. And that applies, by the
way, another really big thing is in social media, the bots. If you're running a
social media company you have to deal with the
bots and they become-- one of the really
exciting things in machine learning and
artificial intelligence, to me, is the very fast improvement
of language models. So neural networks
that generate text, that interpret text, that
generate from text, images and all that kind of stuff. But you're now going to
create incredible bots that look awfully a lot like humans. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, at least they're not going to be those
crypto bots that seem to populate my comment
section when I post anything on Instagram. I actually delete those
even though they add to the comment roster and if-- they bother me so much. I spend at least 10, 15 minutes
on each post just deleting those. I don't know what
they need to do but I'm not interested
in those, whatever it is they're offering. Speaking of nonbots,
I'm going to assume that all the questions
are not from bots. There are a lot of
questions here-- more than 10,000 questions. Goodness. I'll just take a few,
working from top to bottom. What ideas have you been
wrestling with lately? And I think about
the company as one, but as I scroll to the
next, what are some others? LEX FRIDMAN: Well, some of
the things we've talked about, which is the ideas of how
to understand what is true, what is true about a human
being, how to reveal that, how to reveal that
through conversation, how to challenge that
properly, that it leads to understanding not derision. So that applies to
everybody from Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin. Also another idea is there's
a deep distrust of science in trying to understand-- the
growing distrust of science, trying to understand what's
the role of those of us that have a foot in the
scientific community, how to regain some
of that trust. Also, there's-- as we talked
about, how to find and how to-- yeah, how to find and how to
maintain a good relationship. I mean, that's really been-- I've never felt
quite as lonely as I have this year with Ukraine. It's just like, so many
times I would just lay there and just feeling so deeply alone
because I felt that my home-- not my home literally
because I'm an American. I'm a proud American. I'll die an American. But my home in the
sense of generationally, my family's home, is now going-- has been changed forever. There's no more being proud of
being from the former Russia or Ukraine. It's now a political
message to say-- to show your pride, and so
it's been extremely lonely. And within that world, with
all the things I'm pursuing, how do you find a
successful relationship? It has been tough. But obviously-- and
there's a huge number of technical ideas
with the startup of, like, how the hell do
you make this thing work? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,
the relationship topic is one we talked a
little bit about, and last time we touched on
in a little bit more detail. We're going to come back to
that, so I've made a note here. What or who inspired
Lex, you, to wear a suit every time you podcast? That's a good question. I don't know the answer to that. LEX FRIDMAN: So there's two
answers to that question. One is a suit and two is
a black suit and black tie because I used to do-- I used to have more variety,
which is like it was always a black suit but
I would sometimes do a red tie and a blue tie. But that was mostly me
trying to fit in to society because varieties-- you're
supposed to have some variety. What inspired me at first
was a general culture that doesn't take
itself seriously in terms of how you present
yourself to the world. So in academia,
in the tech world, at Google, everybody was wearing
pajamas and very relaxed. In the tech. I don't know how it
is in the science, in the chemistry,
biology, and so on. But in computer science
everybody was very-- I mean, very relaxed in
terms of the stuff they wear so I wanted to try
to really take myself seriously and take every
single moment seriously and everything I do
seriously, and the suit made me feel that way. I don't know how it looks,
but it made me feel that way. And I think, in terms
of people I look up to that wore a suit that made
me think of that is probably Richard Feynman. I see-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: He was
a wonderful human being. LEX FRIDMAN: I see him as the
epitome of class and humor and brilliance, and
obviously I could never come close to that kind of-- be able to simply explain
really complicated ideas and to have humor and wit,
but definitely aspire to that. And then there's
just the Mad Men, that whole era of the '50s,
the classiness of that. There's something
about a suit that both removes the importance
of fashion from the character. You see the person. I think not to-- I forgot who said this. Might be, like, Coco Chanel
or somebody like this. Is that you wear a shabby dress
and everyone sees the dress. You wear a beautiful dress
and everybody sees the woman. So in that sense it was-- hopefully I'm quoting
that correctly, but-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: Sounds good. LEX FRIDMAN: I think
there's a sense in which a simple, classy suit
allows people to focus on your character and then do
so with the full responsibility of that, this is who I am. Yeah. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love
that, and I love what you said just prior to that. My father, who, again,
is always asking me why I don't dress formally
like you do always said to me growing
up, if you overdress slightly, at least people know
that you took them seriously. So it's a sign of respect for
your audience too in my eyes. Someone asked, is there an AI
equivalent of psychedelics? And I'm assuming they
mean is there something that machines can do
for themselves in order to alter their neural circuitry
through unconventional activation patterns. LEX FRIDMAN: Yes, obviously. Well, I don't know exactly
how psychedelics work, but you can see that with
all the diffusion models now with Dali and the
stable diffusion that generates from text, art. It's basically a small
injection of noise into a system that has
a deep representation of visual information. So it is able to convert text to
art in introducing uncertainty into that noise into that. That's kind of maybe. I could see that as a
parallel to psychedelics, and it's able to create
some incredible things. From a conceptual
understanding of a thing, it can create incredible
art that no human, I think, could have at least
easily created through a bit of
introduction of randomness. Randomness does a lot of work
in the machine learning world. Just enough. ANDREW HUBERMAN: There are
a lot of requests of you for relationship,
a lot of requests about statistics about you,
data about you specifically. Flipping past those,
what was the hardest belt to achieve in jujitsu? I would have assumed
the black belt, but is that actually true? LEX FRIDMAN: No. I mean, everybody has
a different journey through jujitsu, as people know. For me, the black belt
was the ceremonial belt, which is not usually the case,
because I fought the wars. I trained twice a day for I
don't know how many years-- seven, eight years. I competed nonstop. I competed against people
much better than me. I competed against many
and beaten many black belts and brown belts. I think, for me personally,
the hardest belt was the brown belt because,
for people who know jujitsu, the size of tournament divisions
for blue belts and purple belts is just humongous. Like Worlds, when I competed
at Worlds it was, like, 140 people in a division,
which means you have to win-- I forget how many times,
but seven, eight, nine times in a row to medal. And so I just had to put in a
lot of work during that time. And especially for competitors,
instructors usually really make you earn a belt.
So to earn the purple belt was extremely difficult.
Extremely difficult. And then to earn the brown
belt means I had to compete nonstop against other
purple belts, which are young. You're talking about-- the
people that usually compete are, like, 23, 24,
25-year-olds that are shredded, incredible cardio. They can, for some reason, are
in their life where they can-- no kids, nothing. They can dedicate
everything to this pursuit so they're training two,
three, four times a day. Diet is on point. You're going-- and for me,
because they're usually bigger and taller than me and
just more aggressive, actual good athletes, yeah, I
had to go through a lot of wars to earn that brown
belt. But then-- ANDREW HUBERMAN: I got to
try this jujitsu thing. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, you should. But it's a different-- ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, I tried it. I did the one class, but I
really want to embrace it. LEX FRIDMAN: As you know,
many pursuits like jujitsu are different if you're doing it
in your 20s and 30s and later. It's like it's a different-- you're not-- you can have a
bit of an ego in your 20s. You can have that
fire under you, but you should be more
zenlike and wise and patient later in life. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, one would hope. That's the wisdom. LEX FRIDMAN: I think
Rogan is still a meathead. He still goes hard and
crazy and he's still super competitive on
that, so some people can-- Jocko is somebody like that. ANDREW HUBERMAN:
Well, whatever they're doing they're doing something
right because they're still in it, and that's
super impressive. There were far too many
questions to ask all of them, but several, if not many, asked
a highly appropriate question for where we are in the
arc of this discussion. And this is one, admittedly,
that you ask in your podcast all the time, but I
get the great pleasure of being in the question
asker seat today. And so, what is your
advice to young people? LEX FRIDMAN: So I just
gave a lecture at MIT and the amount of love I
got there is incredible. And so of course, who
you're talking to is usually undergrads, maybe young
graduate students, and so there one person did ask for advice
as a question at the end. I did a bunch of Q&A. So my
answer was that the world will tell you to find a work-life
balance, to explore, to try to-- try different fields
to see what you really connect with, variety,
general education, all that kind of stuff. And I said in your
20s I think you should find one thing
you're passionate about and work harder at that than
you worked at anything else in your life. And if it destroys
you, it destroys you. That's advice for in your 20s. I don't know how universally
true that advice is, but I think at least
give that a chance. Sacrifice, real sacrifice
towards a thing you really care about,
and work your ass off. That said, I've
met so many people, and I'm starting to
think that advice is best applied or best tried in
the engineer disciplines, especially programming. I think there's a bunch of
disciplines in which you can achieve success
with much fewer hours, and it's much more
important to actually have a clarity of
thinking and great ideas and have an energetic mind. The grind in certain disciplines
does not produce great work. I just know that in computer
science and programming it often does. Some of the best people ever
that have built systems, have programmed systems are
usually like the John Carmack kind of people that drink
soda, eat pizza, and program 18 hours a day. So I don't know actually. You have to, I think, really
go discipline specific. So my advice applies
to my own life which has been mostly
spent behind that computer, and for that you really, really
have to put in the hours. And what that means
is essentially it feels like a grind. I do recommend that you should
at least try it in your own. That if you interview some of
the most accomplished people ever, I think if
they're honest with you they're going to
talk about their 20s as a journey of a lot of pain
and a lot of really hard work. I think what really
happens, unfortunately, is a lot of those successful
people later in life will talk about
work-life balance. They'll say, you
know what I learned from that process is that it's
really important to get, like, sun in the morning,
to have health, to have good relationships. ANDREW HUBERMAN: Hire a chef. LEX FRIDMAN: Yeah, a chef. Exactly. But I think you have
forgot-- those people have forgotten the value
of the journey they took to that lesson. I think work-life balance is
best learned the hard way. My own perspective. There are certain things you
can only learn the hard way, and so you should learn
that the hard way. Yeah, so that's
definitely advice. And I should say that I
admire people that work hard. If you want to get
on my good side, I think there are the
people that give everything they got towards something. It doesn't actually
matter what it is, but towards achieving
excellence in a thing. That's the highest thing that
we can reach for as human beings I think is excellence
at a thing. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it. Well, speaking of
excellent at a thing. Whether or not it's teaching
at MIT or the podcast or the company that
resides in the near future that you create-- once again, I'm speaking for
an enormous number of people that excellence and hard
work, certainly, are woven through everything that you do. Every time I sit down with
you I begin and finish with such an immense feeling
of joy and appreciation and gratitude, and it wouldn't
be a Lex Fridman podcast, or in case of Lex even
being a guest on a podcast, if the word love weren't
mentioned at least 10 times. So the feelings of gratitude
for all the work you do, for taking the time here today
to share with us what you're doing, your thoughts,
your insights, what you're perplexed about and what
drives you and your callings. LEX FRIDMAN: Can I read a poem? ANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes, please. He was trying to
cut me off post. That was getting a little long. LEX FRIDMAN: No. No, no, no. I was thinking
about this recently. It's one of my favorite
Robert Frost poems, and I-- because I wrote several
essays on it, as you do, because I think it's a
popular one that's read. Essays being, like, trying
to interpret poetry, and it's one that
sticks with me. I mean, both its calm beauty,
but in the seriousness of what it means because I
ultimately think it's the-- so ""Stopping by a Woods
on a Snowy Evening."" I think it's ultimately
a human being, a man, asking the old Sisyphus, the
old Camus question of, why live? I think this poem,
even though it doesn't seem like it is a
question of a man contending with suicide and
choosing to live. Whose woods these
are, I think I know. His house is in the
village, though. He will not see me stopping
here to watch his woods fill up with snow. My little horse
must think it queer to stop without a farmhouse near
between the woods and frozen lake, the darkest
evening of the year. He gives this
harness bells a shake to ask if there's some mistake. The only other sound's the sweep
of easy wind and downy flake. The woods are lovely,
dark, and deep, but I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep, and miles to go before I sleep. The woods representing
the darkness, the comfort of the woods
representing death, and he's a man choosing to live. Yeah, I think about that often,
especially my darker moments is you have promises to keep. Thank you for having me, Andrew. You're a beautiful human being. I love you, brother. ANDREW HUBERMAN: I
love you, brother. Thank you for joining me today

YouTube Video: iRYZjOuUnlU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYZjOuUnlU,"One of the biggest myths about the Israel-Palestine
conflict is that it's been going on for centuries, that this is all about ancient religious hatreds. In fact, while religion is involved, the conflict
is mostly about two groups of people who claim the same land. And it really only goes back about a century,
to the early 1900s. Around then, the region
along the eastern Mediterranean we now call Israel-Palestine had been under Ottoman rule
for centuries. It was religiously diverse, including mostly
Muslims and Christians but also a small number of Jews, who lived generally in peace. And it was changing in two important ways. First, more people in the region were developing
a sense of being not just ethnic Arabs but Palestinians, a distinct
national identity. At the same time, not so far away in Europe,
more Jews were joining a movement called Zionism, which said that Judaism was not just a religion
but a nationality, one that deserved a nation of its own. And after centuries of persecution, many believed
a Jewish state was their only way of safety. And they saw their historic homeland in the Middle
East as their best hope for establishing it. In the first decades of the 20th century, tens of thousands of European Jews moved there. After World War One, the Ottoman Empire collapsed,
and the British and French Empires carved up the Middle East, with the British taking
control of a region it called the British Mandate for Palestine. At first, the British allowed Jewish immigration. But as more Jews arrived, settling into farming
communes, tension between Jews and Arabs grew. Both sides committed acts of violence. And by the 1930s, the British began limiting Jewish
immigration.  In response,  Jewish militias formed to fight both the local Arabs and to resist British rule. Then came the Holocaust, leading many more
Jews to flee Europe for British Palestine, and galvanizing much of the world in support
of a Jewish state. In 1947, as sectarian violence between Arabs and Jews there grew, the United Nations approved a plan
to divide British Palestine into two separate states: one for Jews, Israel, and one for
Arabs, Palestine. The city of Jerusalem, where Jews, Muslims, and Christians all have have holy sites, it was to become a special international zone.   The plan was meant to give Jews a state, to
establish Palestinian independence, and to end the sectarian violence that the British
could no longer control. The Jews accepted the plan and declared independence as Israel. But Arabs throughout the region saw the UN plan as just more European colonialism trying to steal their land. Many of the Arab states, who had just recently
won independence themselves, declared war on Israel in an effort to establish a unified Arab Palestine where all of British Palestine had been. The new state of Israel won the war. But in
the process, they pushed well past their borders under the UN plan, taking the western half
of Jerusalem and much of the land that was to have been part of Palestine. They also expelled huge numbers of Palestinians
from their homes, creating a massive refugee population whose descendants today number
about 7 million. At the end of the war, Israel controlled all
of the territory except for Gaza, which Egypt controlled, and the West Bank, named because
it's west of the Jordan River, which Jordan controlled. This was the beginning of the decades-long
Arab-Israeli conflict. During this period, many Jews in Arab-majority
countries fled or were expelled, arriving in Israel. Then something happened that transformed the
conflict. In 1967, Israel and the neighboring Arab states fought another war. When it ended, Israel had seized the Golan
Heights from Syria, the West Bank from Jordan, and both Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula from
Egypt. Israel was now occupying the Palestinian territories,
including all of Jerusalem and its holy sites. This left Israel responsible for governing
the Palestinians – a people it had fought for decades. In 1978 Israel and Egypt signed the US-brokered
Camp David Accords and shortly after that, Israel gave Sanai back to Egypt as part of
a peace treaty. At the time this was hugely controversial
in the Arab world. Egypt President Anwar Sadat was assassinated
in part because of outrage against it. But it marked the beginning of the end of
the wider Arab-Israeli conflict. Over the next few decades, the other Arab
states gradually made peace with Israel, even if they never signed formal peace treaties. But Israel's military was still occupying
the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza, and this was when the conflict became
an Israeli-Palestinian struggle. The Palestinian Liberation Organization, which
had formed in the 1960s to seek a Palestinian state, fought against Israel, including through
acts of terrorism. Initially, the PLO claimed all of what had
been British Palestine, meaning it wanted to end the state of Israel entirely. Fighting between Israel and the PLO went on
for years, even including a 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon to kick the group out of Beirut. The PLO later said it would accept dividing
the land between Israel and Palestine, but the conflict continued. As all of this was happening, something dramatic
was changing in the Israel-occupied Palestinian territories: Israelis were moving in. These people are called settlers, and they
made their homes in the West Bank and Gaza whether Palestinians wanted them or not. Some moved for religious reasons, some because
they want to claim the land for Israel, and some just because housing is cheap — and
often subsidized by the Israeli government. Some settlements are cities with thousands
of people; others are small communities deep into the West Bank The settlers are followed by soldiers to guard
them, and the growing settlements force Palestinians off of their land and divide communities. Short-term, they make the occupation much
more painful for Palestinians. Long-term, by dividing up Palestinian land,
they make it much more difficult for the Palestinians to ever have an independent state. Today there are several hundred thousand settlers
in occupied territory even though the international community considers them illegal. By the late 1980s, Palestinian frustration
exploded into the Intifada,  which is the the Arabic word for uprising. It began with mostly protests and boycotts
but soon became violent, and Israel responded with heavy force. A couple hundred Israelis and over a thousand
Palestinians died in the first Intifada. Around the same time, a group of Palestinians
in Gaza, who consider the PLO too secular and too compromise-minded, created Hamas, a violent
extremist group dedicated to Israel's destruction. By the early 1990s, it's clear that Israelis
and Palestinians have to make peace, and leaders from both sides sign the Oslo Accords. This is meant to be the big, first step toward
Israel maybe someday withdrawing from the Palestinian territories, and allowing an independent Palestine. The Oslo Accords establish the Palestinian
Authority, allowing Palestinians a little bit of freedom to govern themselves in certain areas. Hard-liners on both sides opposed the Oslo
accords. Members of Hamas launch suicide bombings to try to sabotage the process. The Israeli right protests peace talks, with
ralliers calling Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin a traitor and a Nazi. Not long after Rabin signs the second round
of Oslo Accords, a far-right Israeli shoots him to death in Tel Aviv. This violence showed how the extremists on
both sides can use violence to derail peace, and keep a permanent conflict going as they
seek the other side's total destruction. That's a dynamic that's been around ever since. Negotiations meant to hammer out the final
details on peace drag on for years, and a big Camp David Summit in 2000 comes up empty. Palestinians come to believe that peace isn't coming, and rise up in a Second
Intifada, this one much more violent than the first. By the time it wound down a few years later, about 1,000
Israelis and 3,200 Palestinians had died. The Second Intifada really changes the conflict.
Israelis become much more skeptical that Palestinians will ever accept peace, or that it's even worth trying. Israeli politics shift right, and the country
builds walls and checkpoints to control Palestinians' movements. They're not really trying to solve the conflict
anymore, just manage it. The Palestinians are left feeling like negotiating
didn't work and violence didn't work, that they're stuck under an ever-growing occupation
with no future as a people. That year, Israel withdraws from Gaza. Hamas
gains power but splits from the Palestinian Authority in a short civil war, dividing Gaza
from the West Bank. Israel puts Gaza under a suffocating blockade,
and unemployment rises to 40%. This is the state of the conflict as we know
it today. It’s relatively new, and it’s
unbearable for Palestinians. In the West Bank, more and more settlements
are smothering Palestinians, who often respond with protests and sometimes with violence,
though most just want normal lives. In Gaza, Hamas and other violent groups have
periodic wars with Israel. The fighting overwhelmingly kills Palestinians,
including lots of civilians. In Israel itself, most people have become
apathetic, and for the most part the occupation keeps the conflict relatively removed from
their daily lives, with moments of brief but horrible violence. There's little political will for peace. No one really knows where the conflict goes
from here. Maybe a Third Intifada. Maybe the Palestinian
Authority collapses. But everyone agrees that things, as they are now, can't 
last much longer -- that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinians is too unstable to last, and that, unless something dramatic changes, whatever comes next will be much worse."

YouTube Video: K7lb6KWBanI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7lb6KWBanI,"Alexander the Great (All Parts) In 334 BC, Alexander, King of Macedonia, began one of the greatest military campaigns in history - against the superpower of the age - the Persian Empire. Just 20 years-old, his brilliant and fearless
leadership won him battle after battle. And in an astonishing 10 year campaign that
took him to the edge of the known world, he carved out one of the largest empires ever known. Few men have had such a massive impact on
the course of history. To the Persians, he was Alexander the Accursed,
but to the west, he was immortalised...  as  Alexander the Great. EPIC HISTORY TV And Invicta Aleksander the Great Part I Ancient Greece. From around 500 BC, this rugged land was the
scene of remarkable developments in art,  philosophy, and warfare. Its two greatest city-states were Athens,
a naval power, where democracy, art, drama and philosophy flourished; and Sparta, an austere, militaristic
 society, famed for its formidable army. In 480 BC, these two city-states had joined
forces to fight an invasion by the mighty  Persian Empire. At the narrow pass of Thermopylae, a small
Greek force, led by 300 Spartans, held up  the enormous Persian army for three days,
before they were finally encircled and killed. Then, in the straits of Salamis, the Greek
fleet defeated the Persian navy ... But they couldn't prevent the Persians burning
the sacred temples of the Athenian acropolis. The next year, at Plataea, the Greeks won
a decisive land battle against the Persians,and forced them to abandon their  invasion.   The next fifty years were the golden age of
classical Greece. But rising tension between Athens and Sparta,
and their allies, eventually led to war, dragging  the Greek world into decades of destructive
fighting. Wars between the Greek city-states continued
for almost a century, leaving them exhausted... and vulnerable to a new, rising power to the
north... For centuries, sophisticated Greeks had viewed
the mountainous kingdom of Macedonia as a  backwater, hicksville - barely Greek at all. But under King Philip II, Macedonia emerged
as a formidable military force. His most famous reform: the introduction of
the sarissa, an 18 foot pike, twice the length of a normal Greek spear, and wielded by trained
infantry fighting in close formation, known as a phalanx. In 338 BC, at the Battle of Chaeronea, Philip's
army crushed the joint forces of Thebes and Athens. Through alliance and conquest, Philip had
already gained control over most of his neighbours. Now, following this victory, he united all
Greece in an alliance known as the Hellenic  League, or League of Corinth, with Philip
as hegemon – or supreme commander. Only Sparta stood aside. Philip began to plan a great campaign - a
Panhellenic, or all-Greek, war against the Persian Empire. Their old foe was now an ailing
superpower, its great riches ripe for the taking... But on the eve of launching his war, Philip
was assassinated by his own bodyguard – victim  of Macedonia's brutal court rivalries. He was succeeded by his 20 year-old son Alexander:
brilliant, restless, tutored by the great philosopher Aristotle, and already an experienced
military commander. Alexander inherited his father's grand plan
to invade Persia, but first he had to secure his own position as king: At home, he had potential rivals executed,
then crushed rebellions in Illyria, Thessaly, and central Greece. He made a special example of Thebes – completely
destroying the ancient city, and selling its people into slavery. In the spring of 334 BC, now ready to launch
his war against the Persian Empire, Alexander led his army across the Hellespont  into Asia
Minor.   It was the start of one of the greatest military
campaigns in history. The Macedonian Army Alexander's army was about 40,000 strong,
drawn from all parts of Greece. The infantry were commanded by the veteran
Macedonian general Parmenion. In the front rank, 9,000 Macedonian phalangites,
armed with the 18-foot sarissa. These were professional soldiers, well-trained
and drilled, who formed up for battle in the phalanx, 16 ranks deep.   This packed formation presented a solid wall
of iron spear-tips, and was virtually unstoppable. But it was also difficult to manoeuvre, and
highly vulnerable to attacks on its flanks  or rear. So 3,000 elite infantry, the hypaspists, or
'shield-bearers', armed with shorter spears, guarded its flanks. They were commanded by
Parmenion's son, Nikanor. The second line of Alexander's army was made
up of 7,000 Greek allies and 5,000 mercenaries, armed as hoplites. They took their name from
the hoplon, their large round shield, and carried, shorter, 8 foot spears.   A hoplite phalanx was not as effective as
the Macedonian phalangites, but still well-armed and heavily armoured for the time.   The Agrianes were the army's elite skirmishers,
expert javelin-throwers from what's now southern Bulgaria.   Other skirmishers from Thrace, and Illyria,
were armed with javelins, slings and bows. The shock troops of Alexander's army were
the Companion Cavalry, 1,800 elite horsemen armed with spear and sword, commanded by Philotas,
another son of Parmenion. Alexander led the royal squadron in person. There were also 1,800 cavalry from Thessaly,
commanded by Kallas, 600 from other parts  of Greece, led by Erigyius, and 900 mounted scouts from Thrace and Paeonia, under Kassander. THE GRANICUS The great Persian Empire was divided into
provinces, called satrapies.  Each satrapy was ruled by a governor, or satrap.   Those in Asia Minor now threatened by Alexander's
invasion met to discuss strategy. Memnon of Rhodes, a skilled Greek general
in Persian service, urged them to avoid battle with Alexander. Instead, he advised them to
use a 'scorched earth' strategy – to burn  villages and crops, and withdraw to the interior - Alexander's army, he promised, would quickly starve.   It was good advice. But the satraps were unwilling
to lay waste to their own provinces without a fight.   So they decided to face Alexander's army at
the River Granicus. The Persian army formed up behind the river,
which was shallow, but 60 feet wide with steep banks.   Their front line was a wall of cavalry, about
10,000 horsemen from across the empire – Medes and Hyrcanians from modern Iran, Bactrians
from Afghanistan, and Paphlagonians from Turkey's Black Sea coast.   Behind, in reserve, were the infantry – several
thousand Greek mercenaries, a common sight in Persian armies at this time. These men fought for Persian gold, and were armed with the round shield and short spear of hoplites. The Persians may have been unsure if they
could trust these men in combat against fellow Greeks,  and so placed them at the rear.   Alexander, determined to attack and destroy
this Persian force before it could retreat, raced to the Granicus with his best troops.   On his left wing, he posted Thessalian, Greek
and Thracian cavalry, under Parmenion's command. In the centre, were the massed spears of the
phalanx, its six divisions commanded by Perdikkas, Koinos, Amyntas, Philip, Meleager, and Krateros.   On the right, Alexander himself, with the
Companion Cavalry under Philotas, as well as the elite hypaspists, the Agrianes javelin-throwers,
and the archers. Alexander, with 13,000 infantry, and 5,000
cavalry in all, was probably slightly outnumbered. But ignoring advice to wait until dawn to
cross the river, he ordered an immediate assault. He sent a squadron of Companion cavalry to
ford the river, followed by a regiment of hypaspists and the Paeonian light cavalry.   Alexander, calling on his men to show their
courage, then led his right wing across the river.   As they reached the middle of the river, the
Greeks came under a hail of javelins, darts and arrows from the Persian line. Those that
made it to the far bank were immediately charged by the Persian cavalry. 🎶 Alexander was in the thick of the fighting. “he attacked where the whole mass of their
cavalry and leaders were stationed. Around him a desperate conflict raged... horses were
jammed against horses and men against men, the Macedonians striving to drive the Persians
away from the river bank, the Persians determined to prevent them crossing and to push them
back into the river.” 🎶 Alexander's attack seemed reckless, but he
was buying time for the rest of his army to cross the river, including the irresistible
Macedonian phalanx. Then suddenly Alexander was fighting for his
life, charged by two Persian nobles. “Rhoesaces rode up to Alexander and struck
him on the head with his sword, breaking off a piece of his helmet. But the helmet broke
the force of the blow, and Alexander struck him down with his lance. Then, from behind,
Spithridates raised his sword against the king, but Black Cleitus, son of Dropidas,
anticipated his blow, struck his arm, and cut it off, sword and all.”   Now the Greek army was across the river, and
the Persian cavalry faced a wall of Macedonian spears. Most turned and fled. 🎶 The speed and shock of Alexander's attack
meant Persia's Greek mercenaries hadn't even had time to join the battle.   Alexander, in a blood-rage, or possibly regarding
these Greeks as traitors, ignored their appeals for mercy. The mercenaries were surrounded
on all sides, and massacred. Alexander had won a great victory. Asia Minor now lay at his mercy.   But the Persian Empire was still a land of
immense wealth and power. Already it was mobilising  its vast resources to face him. If Alexander was to conquer this empire and
take his place in history, he'd next have to face Darius, King of Kings, himself... Now, as Alexander approached Sardis, capital
of the Persian province of Lydia, its  commander surrendered without a fight. But before Alexander could advance further,
he needed to neutralise Persian naval power Persia had a powerful fleet, with major naval
bases around the eastern Mediterranean - that could potentially cut his lines of communication
back to Greece. Rather than challenge the Persians at sea,
Alexander decided to attack their nearest bases: the Greek coastal cities of Miletus
and Halicarnassus. Both put up determined resistance, but were
taken by winter. The following spring of 333 BC, Alexander
continued his advance into Lycia... and Phrygia. At Gordium, he was shown the legendary 'Gordian
Knot' – a prophesy said that whoever could unpick it would rule all Asia.   Alexander simply took his sword, and sliced
it in half. Meanwhile Memnon of Rhodes, a skilled Greek
general in Persian service, led Persian warships into the Aegean, and captured the islands
of Chios and Lesbos. But after Memnon's sudden death from illness,
the offensive was abandoned. The Battle of Issus 18 months had passed since Alexander's army
crossed the Hellespont and invaded the Persian Empire. Now Alexander led his men into Cilicia...
and was soon poised to cross the Nur Mountains into Syria. But then the main Persian army, led by King
Darius III himself, emerged behind the Greek army, to the north. Darius was determined to trap and destroy
Alexander's army, which he outnumbered almost 2 to 1. So he blocked Alexander's only escape route,
by moving his army to the coastal plain near Issus, just 6 miles wide from mountains to
sea. The narrow battlefield would force Alexander
to fight, but it also prevented Darius exploiting his huge numerical advantage. His army, by some estimates, was up to 100,000
strong, and contained some of the finest soldiers in his vast empire - including 10,000 of his
own household troops, known as the Immortals. His best cavalry were massed on his right,
towards the sea, where the ground was better for horses. His best infantry, his Greek mercenary
hoplites, formed the centre. Persian infantry formed his left wing. Alexander deployed his own army for battle,
once again entrusting his left wing, nearest the sea, to Parmenion , with the Greek cavalry
and infantry. In the centre, as always, was the Macedonian
phalanx. Alexander positioned himself and his best
troops on the right wing, toward the mountain slopes – his elite Agriane javelin-throwers,
his archers, and behind them, the Hypaspists and the Companion cavalry. When Alexander saw the strength of the Persian
cavalry facing Parmenion on the left, he moved  across his Thessalian cavalry to reinforce
him. Despite his overwhelming numbers, Darius held
his position behind a small river, the Pinarus, and waited for Alexander to attack. He didn't have to wait long. Alexander called out to his men, urging them
to fight bravely, picking out some by name. Then, at the head of his army's right wing,
he charged. Once again, the speed and shock of the Macedonian
advance sent the enemy reeling back. But in the centre of the battlefield, the
Macedonian phalanx was in trouble. In its  effort to keep up with Alexander, its formation
had become disordered. Now, in fierce fighting, with Darius's Greek
mercenaries, the phalanx was slowly being driven back. Alexander, seeing the danger, regrouped, and
led the Companions in a headlong charge straight at the Persian centre. The Greek mercenaries,
threatened on their flank, were soon in disarray, and the Macedonian phalanx was able to resume
its advance. Alexander fought his way towards the Great
King, Darius himself. Rather than face this apparently mad and fearless
Macedonian king, Darius fled the  battlefield  in his royal chariot. Meanwhile the Macedonian left wing, under
Parmenion, was in a desperate fight against the best of the Persian cavalry. If the Persians could break through here, they could envelop Alexander's army, and snatch victory from
the jaws of defeat. But Parmenion and his troops fought doggedly,
and continued to hold the Persians at bay. As the news that Darius had fled spread among
his troops, they abandoned the fight, and tried to save themselves. The battle turned into a massacre. Ptolemy, one of the Macedonian commanders,
told Alexander there were so many Persian dead, his men had used them to fill a deep
ravine, so they could cross over it. Son of Amun The Battle of Issus was a stunning victory
for Alexander. And amongst the spoils of victory, were Darius's
wife, mother, and three children, all taken alive, and well treated by Alexander. With the Persian field army in retreat, Alexander
now turned to subduing the western territories of the Persian empire. The next year, 332,
the coastal cities of Phoenicia submitted to Alexander – ending Persian naval power
in the Mediterranean. But the island-city of Tyre resisted. Tyre's defenders fought bravely and skilfully
– even when Alexander began building a causeway to the island, protected by two giant siege
towers... which they counter-attacked with fire ships. But after seven months, the city walls were
breached, and Tyre fell. Most of its citizens were killed or enslaved. Gaza too was taken by siege. Alexander continued to Pelusium, on the Nile
Delta, where the Persian governor of Egypt surrendered the entire province to Alexander, along with the royal treasury. At Memphis, priests of this ancient land welcomed
Alexander as their liberator from Persian rule,  and crowned him Pharaoh.   At the mouth of the Nile, he founded a new
city, Alexandria... then travelled to the  desert oracle of Siwah, where, according to some accounts, the priests welcomed him as  son of Amun, king of the gods. Alexander returned east to Tyre... where in
331 BC, he received news of trouble back home. Despite his great victories over the Persians,
many Greeks regarded Alexander as a tyrant. King Agis of Sparta, with Persian support,
now launched a revolt against Macedonia. Antipater, Alexander's commander in Greece,
was already dealing with rebellion in Thrace. But he quickly marched south... and met Agis
in battle near the city of Megalopolis. Even the legendary Spartans were now no match
for Macedonian military power. The Spartan army was crushed. King Agis himself was among the fallen. With his base in Greece secure once more,
Alexander advanced towards the Persian heartlands, seeking a final showdown with Darius. He received a letter from the Persian king,
offering him a fortune in gold, his daughter  in marriage, and half his empire in exchange for peace. But Alexander's stunning victories, all the
oracles and acclamations, had now convinced him that his destiny was to rule the world... He rejected the Persian king's offer. He didn't
want half the empire - he was coming to  take it all... In 334 BC, Alexander, 21 year-old ruler of
the small Greek kingdom of Macedonia, led an invasion of the vast Persian Empire. It seemed impossible odds, but thanks to Greek
military dominance, and Alexander's fearless leadership, he won two great battles against
the Persians… at the River Granicus, and at Issus. Having subdued Persian lands west of the Euphrates
River, he now headed east into the empire's heartlands, seeking a final showdown with
the Persian King, Darius III. Receiving news that a great Persian army,
led by Darius, had assembled at Gaugemela, near modern Mosul in Iraq – he made straight
for it. This was Darius's last chance to stop Alexander
– and Alexander's chance to smash Persian power once and for all. The Battle of Gaugamela Darius had chosen to fight on open ground,
where his advantage in numbers would be more telling. His soldiers had also worked hard to clear
and flatten the terrain, to make it suitable for Persian war chariots. By modern estimates, the Persian Army was
between 50 and 80,000 strong, and made  up of contingents from across the empire: infantry from Syria and Babylonia... cavalry from Armenia, India and Central Asia... up to 200 scythed chariots... even a handful
of war elephants. Alexander's army was smaller, and may have
been outnumbered by as much as two to one. He deployed his units in their usual formation: On the left flank, Thracian and Thessalian
cavalry, commanded by Parmenion. In the centre, the Macedonian veterans of
the phalanx – each armed with their 18 foot sarissa pike. On the right flank, Alexander with his elite
cavalry, the Companions; and his best infantry, the hypaspists. These were the units with
which Alexander planned to launch his main attack. Greek hoplites formed a second line, and supported
both wings – which were angled back, to guard against encirclement by the Persians. The battle began when Alexander led his wing
out to the right – a move that took the Persians by surprise. Could Alexander really be trying to encircle
their huge army? The Persians mirrored his movement, taking
troops away from their centre, to outflank Alexander, and prevent him leaving the area
they'd cleared for the Persian chariots. But Alexander's unusual manoeuvre was a trap
- to entice the Persians to weaken their centre. When he saw that it had worked, he ordered
his Greek cavalry to charge, to keep the Persians fixed in position. A giant cavalry battle developed on the right
wing. Darius, meanwhile, judging this to be the
decisive moment, unleashed his chariots. But expert Agrianes javelin-throwers took out
horses and crews – while the Greek infantry opened lanes, allowing the chariots to pass harmlessly through. Now Alexander led his Companion cavalry, and
parts of the Macedonian phalanx, in a headlong charge straight at the weakened Persian centre, fighting his way towards Darius himself. The sudden ferocity of Alexander's assault
threw the Persians into panic – the centre of the army broke and ran - King Darius himself leading the rout. But Alexander's left wing was in serious trouble
– Parmenion, facing a huge onslaught by Persian cavalry, was virtually surrounded - Indian and Scythian 
horsemen had even ridden through a gap in the Greek line – but rather
than wheeling and attacking the Greeks from behind, they'd carried straight on to loot their camp. Parmenion sent a desperate appeal to Alexander
for help. The King abandoned his pursuit of Darius,
regrouped, and charged the Persian right wing. It was the hardest and bloodiest fighting
of the battle – claiming the lives of sixty of Alexander's Companions. Finally, as news of Darius's flight spread
across the battlefield, the last Persian horsemen turned and fled. The Battle of Gaugamela was a stunning and
complete victory for Alexander. According to ancient sources, he lost just
a few hundred men, while the Persians lost thousands. Alexander had routed Darius's great army,
and now the road to Babylon – the  empire's main capital - lay open. The Macedonian king entered the great city
in triumph, recognised by Persian officials as its new rightful ruler. So too at the city of Susa, where Alexander
ceremonially took his seat upon the royal throne of Persia. In the Zagros mountains, at a pass known as
the Persian Gates, a courageous Persian force  held up Alexander's army for a month. The Greeks eventually found a mountain path
that bypassed their position, allowing them  to encircle and wipe out the defenders. In early 330 BC, Alexander reached Persepolis,
the empire's ceremonial capital. Alexander wanted to appear as a liberator
to the Persians – as a legitimate  
 successor to King Darius - but now, he ordered Persepolis
to be pillaged and burnt – retribution for the Persian invasion of Greece, and the burning
of Athens' sacred temples in 480 BC. Alexander now headed north into Media, where
Darius had taken refuge in the royal city of Ecbatana. Alexander was determined to capture
Darius – but the fugitive king fled east in the hope of raising a new army in the provinces
of Parthia, Bactria, and Sogdia. It was not to be. As Alexander closed in,
the Persian king was murdered by one of his own governors, Bessus, who then proclaimed
himself the empire’s new ruler. Alexander gave orders for Darius to be buried
in the royal tombs of Persepolis, alongside his ancestors. Then he paused to organise his vast new empire. Alexander appointed viceroys to rule the provinces
on his behalf, keeping several Persians - who  had sworn loyalty - in their posts. Then he resumed his march east. His goal: to find and kill the usurper Bessus... subjugate the empire's eastern provinces... and reach the far edge of the world... In 330 BC, Alexander continued his march east. His goal: to find and kill Bessus - a Persian
usurper, claiming to be the rightful king – and to subjugate the empire's eastern
provinces... Alexander headed first for Aria, today part
of Afghanistan, where the Persian  governor  Satibarzanes had launched a revolt – after
initially pretending to submit to Alexander. The rebellion was crushed, and Satibarzanes
killed in single combat by a Greek cavalry officer. Nearby, Alexander founded the city of Alexandria
Ariana, modern Herat – one of around a dozen cities that Alexander would eventually found,
almost all bearing his name. Alexander marched on to Phrada. The Macedonian court had a long tradition
of plots and assassination. Six years before,  Alexander's own father, King Philip, had been murdered by his bodyguard. He was now informed that Philotas, commander
of his Companion Cavalry, had uncovered a  plot to assassinate Alexander, but kept it secret. Philotas, and his father Parmenion, were among
the most respected of Alexander's commanders, and had played crucial roles in all his great
victories. But when Philotas confessed under torture, Alexander had him executed. then sent assassins  back to Ecbatana, where Parmenion was governor, to kill him before he even heard of his son's death, and had a chance to turn against Alexander. In 329, Alexander resumed his pursuit of Bessus. En route, he founded the city of Alexandria
Arachosia – modern Kandahar, in southern Afghanistan. As he reached Kunduz, Bessus was betrayed
by his own men, and handed over in chains. Alexander sent him back to Persia for execution,
as a king-slayer. Alexander pushed on into modern Tajikistan,
where the Sogdians rose up against him. He  had to fight off attacks by local tribes,
and take several towns by assault. On the banks of the Jaxartes River, he founded
the city of Alexandria-Eschate, meaning Alexandria  'the Furthest' – so-named because he had,
at last, reached the limit of the Persian Empire. This frontier was frequently raided by nomads,
known to the Greeks as Scythians. Alexander lured them into a decisive battle
near the Jaxartes. The result was a crushing  victory for the Macedonian king, that put an end to the raids. But fighting against Bactrian and Sogdian
tribes continued, frustrating Alexander, and tying him down in a difficult guerilla war. Tyrant By now, many of the Macedonian troops were
unhappy with Alexander. Most had not seen  their homes in years, but their king seemed bent on conquest without end. What was worse,  he'd begun to adopt the rituals and dress of their defeated Persian enemy – customs they viewed as effeminate, and decadent. At Maracanda, modern Samarkand, after a furious,
drunken argument, Alexander killed Cleitus the Black. Cleitus had been one of Alexander's best generals,
and the man who'd saved his life at the Battle of the Granicus. Alexander was full of remorse, but his growing
arrogance was alienating more and more old comrades. When he tried to make his countrymen perform
the traditional Persian ritual of proskynesis – prostrating themselves before the king
- he crossed a line. To Greeks this was blasphemy – only a god
was worthy of such respect - and Alexander was forced to back down. In Bactria, another plot to assassinate Alexander
was uncovered. This time the ringleader was a royal page – one of the sons of Macedonian
nobility who attended the king. Hermolaus had become murderously bitter towards Alexander over a perceived injustice. He and his accomplices were tortured, and then stoned to death. Callisthenes, Alexander's official historian,
was also implicated in the conspiracy. He  was thrown in prison, where he later died. That summer, in 327 - according to legend
- Alexander became captivated by the beauty of Roxana,  daughter of a Bactrian lord. Their marriage was also a sound political
move, helping to end local revolt against his rule – and allowing him to continue
his advance... into modern Pakistan, and India. To the Edge of the World Alexander now prepared to subdue the Persian
Empire's most eastern provinces, which had yet to recognise his kingship. To do so he would first have to cross the
Hindu Kush mountains and reach the Indus river valley. Advancing in two columns, his army won a series
of skirmishes against the Aspasii and Assaceni, as they fought their way into what's now the
Swat Valley of northern Pakistan. After a fierce siege, Alexander took the Assacenian
capital of Massaga. According to legend it was ruled by a beautiful
queen, Cleophis, who bore Alexander a  son, and was allowed to keep her throne. The ruler of Taxila, near modern Islamabad,
had formed an alliance with Alexander. Together they marched to face Porus, king
of Pauravas, at the Battle of the Hydaspes. It was Alexander's costliest battle, as Porus's
war elephants inflicted terrible casualties amongst the Greeks. But despite Porus's fearless leadership, the
battle ended in a decisive victory for Alexander, winning him control of the Punjab. Alexander wanted to push on into India, to
reach the great river which ancient Greek geographers said formed the edge of the world. But at the River Hyphasis, known today as
the Beas, his army mutinied. His men had marched thousands of miles, fought
countless battles, and not seen their homes in 8 years. They'd heard rumours of gigantic
armies waiting for them in India. They refused to go any further. Alexander was furious, but had to turn the
army around. He followed the rivers of the Punjab to the
sea – a journey that took 10 months. On the way, he defeated the Mahlians, but while
leading the assault on their capital, was wounded in the chest and nearly killed. After reaching the coast, part of the army under
Nearchus, she boarded and returned by sea to Persia. sailing through the Strait
Hormuz and swam to the Persian Gulf. It was one of the great ancient voyages of
exploration, as these waters had been previously unknown to Greeks. Meanwhile Alexander led the rest of the army
back by land through the Gedrosian desert, today in southern Pakistan. But extreme heat
and shortages of food and water led to terrible suffering, and many deaths among his army. On his return to Persia, Alexander executed
several of his viceroys and governors - men accused of ruling unjustly, and robbing temples
and tombs, during his long absence in the east. At Susa, he arranged a magnificent mass-marriage
of Macedonian officers to 80 Persian  noblewomen, to strengthen bonds between his two kingdoms. Alexander himself married two Persian princesses. He also paid all his soldiers debts, and ordered
30,000 youths from across the empire to be trained  in the Macedonian art of war. But at Opis, his Macedonian troops mutinied. They were offended by Alexander's apparent preference for Persian advisors and Persian ways. Alexander had the ringleaders executed, and made a speech to the men, reminding them
of the glories they'd won together, and leading eventually to an emotional reconciliation. At Ecbatana, Alexander's closest and most
trusted friend, Hephaestion, died of fever. The king was grief stricken, went days without
eating, and ordered a period of public mourning across the empire. Alexander waged a successful campaign against
the mountain raiders of Cossaea, who not even the Persian kings had been able to subdue. Returning to Babylon, he was met by embassies
from distant peoples, come to recognise his greatness – Aethiopians, Libyans, European Scythians, Lucanians, Etruscans, Gauls and Iberians. Alexander's Bactrian wife Roxana was now pregnant... But as he planned his next campaign, to Arabia
and beyond, he developed a sudden fever, and died days later, aged just 32. The cause of Alexander's death has never been
established. It may have been malaria, cholera, typhus... or poison. The Successors Alexander died undefeated in battle. His reputation
as a brilliant, fearless and daring military commander remains undimmed. His decade long campaign created one of the
largest empires ever known, stretching from Greece to Pakistan. But it was vast and unstable, held together
only by his own brilliance and name. Alexander left no plans for his succession,
and his generals soon began fighting among themselves to carve out their own empires. In the Wars of the Successors, Alexander's
widow Roxana and his young son were murdered. His own gold sarcophagus, en route to Macedonia
for burial was hijacked, and ended up in Alexandria, in Egypt. Today, it's location remains one of the world's
great unsolved mysteries. Few men have ever had such an impact on the
course of history as Alexander the Great. The breath-taking achievements of his short
life ushered in the Hellenistic Age, as Greek  ideas spread across the territory of his former
empire, fusing with local traditions to trigger new developments in art, science, government
and language. Some of the successor kingdoms to his great
empire were short-lived – others endured for centuries.. but all, in turn, would fall to new forces... and in the west, to the rising power of Rome. Research and artwork for this video comes

This article is about the ancient king of Macedonia. For other uses, see Alexander the Great (disambiguation)

Alexander III of Macedon (Ancient Greek: Ἀλέξανδρος, romanized: Alexandros; 20/21 July 356 BC – 10/11 June 323 BC), most commonly known as Alexander the Great,[c] was a king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedonia.[d] He succeeded his father Philip II to the throne in 336 BC at the age of 20 and spent most of his ruling years conducting a lengthy military campaign throughout Western Asia, Central Asia, parts of South Asia, and Egypt. By the age of 30, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to northwestern India.[1] He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered to be one of history's greatest and most successful military commanders.[3][4]

Until the age of 16, Alexander was tutored by Aristotle. In 335 BC, shortly after his assumption of kingship over Macedon, he campaigned in the Balkans and reasserted control over Thrace and parts of Illyria before marching on the city of Thebes, which was subsequently destroyed in battle. Alexander then led the League of Corinth, and used his authority to launch the pan-Hellenic project envisaged by his father, assuming leadership over all Greeks in their conquest of Persia.[6]

In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid Persian Empire and began a series of campaigns that lasted for 10 years. Following his conquest of Asia Minor, Alexander broke the power of Achaemenid Persia in a series of decisive battles, including those at Issus and Gaugamela; he subsequently overthrew Darius III and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety.[e] After the fall of Persia, the Macedonian Empire held a vast swath of territory between the Adriatic Sea and the Indus River. Alexander endeavored to reach the ""ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea"" and invaded India in 326 BC, achieving an important victory over Porus, an ancient Indian king of present-day Punjab, at the Battle of the Hydaspes. Due to the mutiny of his homesick troops, he eventually turned back at the Beas River and later died in 323 BC in Babylon, the city of Mesopotamia that he had planned to establish as his empire's capital. Alexander's death left unexecuted an additional series of planned military and mercantile campaigns that would have begun with a Greek invasion of Arabia. In the years following his death, a series of civil wars broke out across the Macedonian Empire, eventually leading to its disintegration at the hands of the Diadochi.

With his death marking the start of the Hellenistic period, Alexander's legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism that his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism and Hellenistic Judaism. He founded more than twenty cities, with the most prominent being the city of Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture led to the overwhelming dominance of Hellenistic civilization and influence as far east as the Indian subcontinent. The Hellenistic period developed through the Roman Empire into modern Western culture; the Greek language became the lingua franca of the region and was the predominant language of the Byzantine Empire until its collapse in the mid-15th century AD.

Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of Achilles, featuring prominently in the historical and mythical traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. His military achievements and unprecedented enduring successes in battle made him the measure against which many later military leaders would compare themselves,[f] and his tactics remain a significant subject of study in military academies worldwide. Legends of Alexander's exploits coalesced into the third-century Alexander Romance which, in the premodern period, went through over one hundred recensions, translations, and derivations and was translated into almost every European vernacular and every language of the Islamic world.[8] After the Bible, it was the most popular form of European literature.[9]

Early life

Lineage and childhood

Archaeological site of Pella, Greece, Alexander's birthplace

Alexander III was born in Pella, the capital of the Kingdom of Macedon,[10] on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of Hekatombaion, which probably corresponds to 20 July 356 BC (although the exact date is uncertain).[11][12] He was the son of the erstwhile king of Macedon, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias (daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of Epirus).[13][g] Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely because she gave birth to Alexander.

Roman medallion depicting Olympias, Alexander's mother

Several legends surround Alexander's birth and childhood. According to the ancient Greek biographer Plutarch, on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip, Olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunderbolt that caused a flame to spread ""far and wide"" before dying away. Sometime after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with a seal engraved with a lion's image.[16] Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations for these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was Zeus. Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming that she had told Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.[16]

On the day Alexander was born, Philip was preparing a siege on the city of Potidea on the peninsula of Chalcidice. That same day, Philip received news that his general Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian and Paeonian armies and that his horses had won at the Olympic Games. It was also said that on this day, the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, burnt down. This led Hegesias of Magnesia to say that it had burnt down because Artemis was away, attending the birth of Alexander.[17] Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly at his instigation, to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception.

In his early years, Alexander was raised by a nurse, Lanike, sister of Alexander's future general Cleitus the Black. Later in his childhood, Alexander was tutored by the strict Leonidas, a relative of his mother, and by Lysimachus of Acarnania. Alexander was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths, learning to read, play the lyre, ride, fight, and hunt. When Alexander was ten years old, a trader from Thessaly brought Philip a horse, which he offered to sell for thirteen talents. The horse refused to be mounted, and Philip ordered it away. Alexander, however, detecting the horse's fear of its own shadow, asked to tame the horse, which he eventually managed. Plutarch stated that Philip, overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition, kissed his son tearfully, declaring: ""My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions. Macedon is too small for you"", and bought the horse for him.[20] Alexander named it Bucephalas, meaning ""ox-head"". Bucephalas carried Alexander as far as India. When the animal died (because of old age, according to Plutarch, at age 30), Alexander named a city after him, Bucephala.[21]

Education

When Alexander was 13, Philip began to search for a tutor, and considered such academics as Isocrates and Speusippus, the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of the Academy to take up the post. In the end, Philip chose Aristotle and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at Mieza as a classroom. In return for teaching Alexander, Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle's hometown of Stageira, which Philip had razed, and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex-citizens who were slaves, or pardoning those who were in exile.[22]

Mieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles, such as Ptolemy, Hephaistion, and Cassander. Many of these students would become his friends and future generals, and are often known as the ""Companions"". Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works of Homer, and in particular the Iliad; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.[23] Alexander was able to quote Euripides from memory.[24]

In his youth, Alexander was also acquainted with Persian exiles at the Macedonian court, who received the protection of Philip II for several years as they opposed Artaxerxes III.[26][27] Among them were Artabazos II and his daughter Barsine, possible future mistress of Alexander, who resided at the Macedonian court from 352 to 342 BC, as well as Amminapes, future satrap of Alexander, and a Persian nobleman named Sisines.[28][29][30] This gave the Macedonian court a good knowledge of Persian issues, and may even have influenced some of the innovations in the management of the Macedonian state.[28]

Suda writes that Anaximenes of Lampsacus was one of Alexander's teachers, and that Anaximenes also accompanied Alexander on his campaigns.[31]

Heir of Philip II

Regency and ascent of Macedon

At the age of 16, Alexander's education under Aristotle ended. Philip II had waged war against the Thracians to the north, which left Alexander in charge as regent and heir apparent. During Philip's absence, the Thracian tribe of Maedi revolted against Macedonia. Alexander responded quickly and drove them from their territory. The territory was colonized, and a city, named Alexandropolis, was founded.[32]

Upon Philip's return, Alexander was dispatched with a small force to subdue the revolts in southern Thrace. Campaigning against the Greek city of Perinthus, Alexander reportedly saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city of Amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to Apollo near Delphi, a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. While Philip was occupied in Thrace, Alexander was ordered to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander.

Philip and his army joined his son in 338 BC, and they marched south through Thermopylae, taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison. They went on to occupy the city of Elatea, only a few days' march from both Athens and Thebes. The Athenians, led by Demosthenes, voted to seek alliance with Thebes against Macedonia. Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win Thebes's favour, but Athens won the contest.[34] Philip marched on Amphissa (ostensibly acting on the request of the Amphictyonic League), capturing the mercenaries sent there by Demosthenes and accepting the city's surrender. Philip then returned to Elatea, sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, who both rejected it.[35]

Battle plan from the Battle of Chaeronea

As Philip marched south, his opponents blocked him near Chaeronea, Boeotia. During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea, Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated.[36]

After the victory at Chaeronea, Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese, devastating much of Laconia and ejecting the Spartans from various parts of it.[37] At Corinth, Philip established a ""Hellenic Alliance"" (modelled on the old anti-Persian alliance of the Greco-Persian Wars), which included most Greek city-states except Sparta. Philip was then named Hegemon (often translated as ""Supreme Commander"") of this league (known by modern scholars as the League of Corinth), and announced his plans to attack the Persian Empire.

Exile and return

When Philip returned to Pella, he fell in love with and married Cleopatra Eurydice in 338 BC,[40] the niece of his general Attalus. The marriage made Alexander's position as heir less secure, since any son of Cleopatra Eurydice would be a fully Macedonian heir, while Alexander was only half-Macedonian. During the wedding banquet, a drunken Attalus publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir.

At the wedding of Cleopatra, whom Philip fell in love with and married, she being much too young for him, her uncle Attalus in his drink desired the Macedonians would implore the gods to give them a lawful successor to the kingdom by his niece. This so irritated Alexander that throwing one of the cups at his head, ""You villain,"" said he, ""what, am I then a bastard?"" Then Philip, taking Attalus's part, rose up and would have run his son through; but by good fortune for them both, either his over-hasty rage, or the wine he had drunk, made his foot slip, so that he fell down on the floor, at which Alexander reproachfully insulted him: ""See there,"" said he, ""the man who makes preparations to pass out of Europe into Asia, overturned in passing from one seat to another."" Plutarch, describing the feud at Philip's wedding. [ 43 ]

In 337 BC, Alexander fled Macedon with his mother, dropping her off with her brother, King Alexander I of Epirus in Dodona, capital of the Molossians. He continued to Illyria where he sought refuge with one or more Illyrian kings, perhaps with Glaucias, and was treated as a guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before.[45] However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son. Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, Demaratus, who mediated between the two parties.[46]

In the following year, the Persian satrap (governor) of Caria, Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus. Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him. Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends, Harpalus, Nearchus, Ptolemy and Erigyius, and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains.[47]

King of Macedon

Accession

Pausanias assassinates Philip II, Alexander's father, during his procession into the theatre

In the 24th day of the Macedonian month Dios, which probably corresponds to 25 October 336 BC,[48][49] while at Aegae attending the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra to Olympias's brother, Alexander I of Epirus, Philip was assassinated by the captain of his bodyguards, Pausanias.[h] As Pausanias tried to escape, he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers, including two of Alexander's companions, Perdiccas and Leonnatus. Alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and army at the age of 20.[51][52]

Consolidation of power

Alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne. He had his cousin, the former Amyntas IV, executed. He also had two Macedonian princes from the region of Lyncestis killed for having been involved in his father's assassination, but spared a third, Alexander Lyncestes. Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice, and Europa, her daughter by Philip, burned alive. When Alexander learned about this, he was furious. Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus, who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatra's uncle.[54]

Attalus was at that time corresponding with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens. Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander, and following Cleopatra's murder, Alexander may have considered him too dangerous to be left alive.[54] Alexander spared Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts mentally disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias.[52][55]

News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt, including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon. When news of the revolts reached Alexander, he responded quickly. Though advised to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thessaly. He found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa, and ordered his men to ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force. He then continued south towards the Peloponnese.[56]

Alexander stopped at Thermopylae where he was recognized as the leader of the Amphictyonic League before heading south to Corinth. Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels. The famous encounter between Alexander and Diogenes the Cynic occurred during Alexander's stay in Corinth. When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could do for him, the philosopher disdainfully asked Alexander to stand a little to the side, as he was blocking the sunlight. This reply apparently delighted Alexander who is reported to have said, ""But verily, if I were not Alexander, I would like to be Diogenes."" At Corinth, Alexander took the title of Hegemon (""leader"") and, like Philip, was appointed commander for the coming war against Persia. He also received news of a Thracian uprising.[59]

Balkan campaign

The Macedonian phalanx at the ""Battle of the Carts"" against the Thracians in 335 BC

Before crossing to Asia, Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders. In the spring of 335 BC, he advanced to suppress several revolts. Starting from Amphipolis, he travelled east into the country of the ""Independent Thracians"", and at Mount Haemus, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights.[60] The Macedonians marched into the country of the Triballi and defeated their army near the Lyginus river[61] (a tributary of the Danube). Alexander then marched for three days to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish.[62]

News then reached Alexander that the Illyrian chieftain Cleitus and King Glaukias of the Taulantii were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier.[63]

Destruction of Thebes

While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south. While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace. Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign, leaving Antipater as regent.[65]

After his victory at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), Philip II began the work of establishing himself as hēgemṓn (Greek: ἡγεμών) of a league which according to Diodorus was to wage a campaign against the Persians for the sundry grievances Greece suffered in 480 and free the Greek cities of the western coast and islands from Achaemenid rule. In 336 he sent Parmenion, Amyntas, Andromenes, Attalus, and an army of 10,000 men into Anatolia to make preparations for an invasion.[66][67] The Greek cities on the western coast of Anatolia revolted until the news arrived that Philip had been murdered and had been succeeded by his young son Alexander. The Macedonians were demoralized by Philip's death and were subsequently defeated near Magnesia by the Achaemenids under the command of the mercenary Memnon of Rhodes.[66][67]

Taking over the invasion project of Philip II, Alexander's army crossed the Hellespont in 334 BC with approximately 48,100 soldiers, 6,100 cavalry, and a fleet of 120 ships with crews numbering 38,000 drawn from Macedon and various Greek city states, mercenaries, and feudally raised soldiers from Thrace, Paionia, and Illyria.[68][i] He showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods. This also showed Alexander's eagerness to fight, in contrast to his father's preference for diplomacy.

After an initial victory against Persian forces at the Battle of the Granicus, Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provincial capital and treasury of Sardis; he then proceeded along the Ionian coast, granting autonomy and democracy to the cities. Miletus, held by Achaemenid forces, required a delicate siege operation, with Persian naval forces nearby. Further south, at Halicarnassus, in Caria, Alexander successfully waged his first large-scale siege, eventually forcing his opponents, the mercenary captain Memnon of Rhodes and the Persian satrap of Caria, Orontobates, to withdraw by sea.[69] Alexander left the government of Caria to a member of the Hecatomnid dynasty, Ada, who adopted Alexander.[70]

From Halicarnassus, Alexander proceeded into mountainous Lycia and the Pamphylian plain, asserting control over all coastal cities to deny the Persians naval bases. From Pamphylia onwards, the coast held no major ports and Alexander moved inland. At Termessos, Alexander humbled and did not storm the Pisidian city.[71] At the ancient Phrygian capital of Gordium, Alexander ""undid"" the hitherto unsolvable Gordian Knot, a feat said to await the future ""king of Asia"".[72] According to the story, Alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone, and hacked it apart with his sword.[73]

The Levant and Syria

In spring 333 BC, Alexander crossed the Taurus into Cilicia. After a long pause due to an illness, he marched on towards Syria. Though outmanoeuvered by Darius's significantly larger army, he marched back to Cilicia, where he defeated Darius at Issus. Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother Sisygambis, and a fabulous treasure.[74] He offered a peace treaty that included the lands he had already lost, and a ransom of 10,000 talents for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.[75] Alexander proceeded to take possession of Syria, and most of the coast of the Levant.[70] In the following year, 332 BC, he was forced to attack Tyre, which he captured after a long and difficult siege.[76][77] The men of military age were massacred and the women and children sold into slavery.[78]

Egypt

When Alexander destroyed Tyre, most of the towns on the route to Egypt quickly capitulated. However, Alexander was met with resistance at Gaza. The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill, requiring a siege. When ""his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible... this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the attempt"".[79] After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold fell, but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound. As in Tyre, men of military age were put to the sword, and the women and children were sold into slavery.[80]

Egypt was only one of a large number of territories taken by Alexander from the Persians. After his trip to Siwa, Alexander was crowned in the temple of Ptah at Memphis. It appears that the Egyptian people did not find it disturbing that he was a foreigner – nor that he was absent for virtually his entire reign.[81] Alexander restored the temples neglected by the Persians and dedicated new monuments to the Egyptian gods. In the temple of Luxor, near Karnak, he built a chapel for the sacred barge. During his brief months in Egypt, he reformed the taxation system on the Greek models and organized the military occupation of the country, but in early 331 BC he left for Asia in pursuit of the Persians.[81]

Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332 BC where he was regarded as a liberator.[82] To legitimize taking power and be recognized as the descendant of the long line of pharaohs, Alexander made sacrifices to the gods at Memphis and went to consult the famous oracle of Amun-Ra at the Siwa Oasis in the Libyan desert,[81] at which he was pronounced the son of the deity Amun. Henceforth, Alexander often referred to Zeus-Ammon as his true father, and after his death, currency depicted him adorned with horns, using the Horns of Ammon as a symbol of his divinity.[84] The Greeks interpreted this message – one that the gods addressed to all pharaohs – as a prophecy.[81]

During his stay in Egypt, he founded Alexandria, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom after his death.[85] Control of Egypt passed to Ptolemy I (son of Lagos), the founder of the Ptolemaic Dynasty (305–30 BC) after the death of Alexander.

Assyria and Babylonia

Entry of Alexander into Babylon by Charles Le Brun (1665)

Leaving Egypt in 331 BC, Alexander marched eastward into Achaemenid Assyria in Upper Mesopotamia (now northern Iraq) and defeated Darius again at the Battle of Gaugamela.[87] Darius once more fled the field, and Alexander chased him as far as Arbela. Gaugamela would be the final and decisive encounter between the two.[88] Darius fled over the mountains to Ecbatana (modern Hamadan) while Alexander captured Babylon.[89]

Babylonian astronomical diaries say that ""the king of the world, Alexander"" sent his scouts with a message to the people of Babylon before entering the city: ""I shall not enter your houses"".[90]

Persia

From Babylon, Alexander went to Susa, one of the Achaemenid capitals, and captured its treasury.[89] He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of Persepolis via the Persian Royal Road. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He then stormed the pass of the Persian Gates (in the modern Zagros Mountains) which had been blocked by a Persian army under Ariobarzanes and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.[91]

On entering Persepolis, Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days.[92] Alexander stayed in Persepolis for five months. During his stay, a fire broke out in the eastern palace of Xerxes I and spread to the rest of the city. Possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the Second Persian War by Xerxes; Plutarch and Diodorus allege that Alexander's companion, the hetaera Thaïs, instigated and started the fire. Even as he watched the city burn, Alexander immediately began to regret his decision.[96][97] Plutarch claims that he ordered his men to put out the fires but the flames had already spread to most of the city. Curtius claims that Alexander did not regret his decision until the next morning. Plutarch recounts an anecdote in which Alexander pauses and talks to a fallen statue of Xerxes as if it were a live person:

Shall I pass by and leave you lying there because of the expeditions you led against Greece, or shall I set you up again because of your magnanimity and your virtues in other respects?[98]

Fall of the Persian Empire and the East

Alexander then chased Darius, first into Media, and then Parthia. The Persian king no longer controlled his own destiny, and was taken prisoner by Bessus, his Bactrian satrap and kinsman. As Alexander approached, Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius's successor as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against Alexander. Alexander buried Darius's remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral. He claimed that, while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne. The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius.[105] However, as basic forms of community life and the general structure of government were maintained and resuscitated by Alexander under his own rule, he, in the words of the Iranologist Pierre Briant ""may therefore be considered to have acted in many ways as the last of the Achaemenids.""

Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him. This campaign, initially against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern Kandahar in Afghanistan, and Alexandria Eschate (""The Furthest"") in modern Tajikistan. The campaign took Alexander through Media, Parthia, Aria (West Afghanistan), Drangiana, Arachosia (South and Central Afghanistan), Bactria (North and Central Afghanistan), and Scythia.

In 329 BC, Spitamenes, who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana, betrayed Bessus to Ptolemy, one of Alexander's trusted companions, and Bessus was executed. However, at some point later when Alexander was on the Jaxartes dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army, Spitamenes raised Sogdiana in revolt. Alexander personally defeated the Scythians at the Battle of Jaxartes and immediately launched a campaign against Spitamenes, defeating him in the Battle of Gabai. After the defeat, Spitamenes was killed by his own men, who then sued for peace.

Problems and plots

The Killing of Cleitus, by André Castaigne (1898–1899)

During this time, Alexander adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors.[110] This was one aspect of Alexander's broad strategy aimed at securing the aid and support of the Iranian upper classes. The Greeks however regarded the gesture of proskynesis as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.

During the long rule of the Achaemenids, the elite positions in many segments of the empire including the central government, the army, and the many satrapies were specifically reserved for Iranians and to a major degree, Persian noblemen. The latter were in many cases additionally connected through marriage alliances with the royal Achaemenid family. This created a problem for Alexander as to whether he had to make use of the various segments and people that had given the empire its solidity and unity for a lengthy period of time. Pierre Briant explains that Alexander realized that it was insufficient to merely exploit the internal contradictions within the imperial system as in Asia Minor, Babylonia or Egypt; he also had to (re)create a central government with or without the support of the Iranians. As early as 334 BC he demonstrated awareness of this, when he challenged incumbent King Darius III ""by appropriating the main elements of the Achaemenid monarchy's ideology, particularly the theme of the king who protects the lands and the peasants"". Alexander wrote a letter in 332 BC to Darius III, wherein he argued that he was worthier than Darius ""to succeed to the Achaemenid throne"". However, Alexander's eventual decision to burn the Achaemenid palace at Persepolis in conjunction with the major rejection and opposition of the ""entire Persian people"" made it impracticable for him to pose himself as Darius' legitimate successor. Against Bessus (Artaxerxes V) however, Briant adds, Alexander reasserted ""his claim to legitimacy as the avenger of Darius III"".

A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, Philotas, was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus Parmenion, who had been charged with guarding the treasury at Ecbatana, was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, Cleitus the Black, during a violent drunken altercation at Maracanda (modern day Samarkand in Uzbekistan), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and especially of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.

Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed. This one was instigated by his own royal pages. His official historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot, and in the Anabasis of Alexander, Arrian states that Callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment, and likely died soon after.[113] It remains unclear if Callisthenes was actually involved in the plot, for prior to his accusation he had fallen out of favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.[114]

Macedon in Alexander's absence

When Alexander set out for Asia, he left his general Antipater, an experienced military and political leader, and part of Philip II's ""Old Guard"", in charge of Macedon.[65] Alexander's sacking of Thebes ensured that Greece remained quiet during his absence.[65] The one exception was a call to arms by Spartan king Agis III in 331 BC, whom Antipater defeated and killed in the battle of Megalopolis.[65] Antipater referred the Spartans' punishment to the League of Corinth, which then deferred to Alexander, who chose to pardon them.[115] There was also considerable friction between Antipater and Olympias, and each complained to Alexander about the other.[116]

In general, Greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during Alexander's campaign in Asia.[117] Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest, which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire.[118] However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon's strength, greatly weakening it in the years after Alexander, and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome after the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC).

Coinage

Silver tetradrachm of Alexander the Great struck by Balakros or his successor Menes, both former somatophylakes (bodyguards) of Alexander, when they held the position of satrap of Cilicia in the lifetime of Alexander, c. 333–327 BC . The obverse shows Heracles, ancestor of the Macedonian royal line and the reverse shows a seated Zeus Aëtophoros. [ 119 ]

The conquest by Philip II of Pangaeum, and then of the island of Thasos between 356 and 342 BC brought rich gold and silver mines under Macedonian control.[120]

Alexander appears to have introduced a new coinage in Cilicia in Tarsus, after the Battle of Issus in 333 BC, which went on to become the main coinage of the empire.[121] Alexander minted gold staters, silver tetradrachms and drachims, and various fractional bronze coins. The types of these coins remained constant in his empire. The gold series had the head of Athena on the obverse and a winged Nike (Victory) on the reverse.[122] The silver coinage had a beardless head of Heracles wearing a lionskin headdress on the obverse and Zeus aetophoros ('eagle bearer') enthroned with a scepter in his left hand, on the reverse.[123] There are both Greek and non-Greek aspects to this design. Heracles and Zeus were important deities for the Macedonians, with Heracles considered to be the ancestor of the Temenid dynasty and Zeus the patron of the main Macedonian sanctuary, Dium.[121] The lion was also the symbolic animal of the Anatolian god Sandas, worshipped at Tarsus.[121] The reverse design of Alexander's tetradrachms is closely modelled on the depiction of the god Baaltars (Baal of Tarsus), on the silver staters minted at Tarsus by the Persian satrap Mazaeus before Alexander's conquest.[121]

Alexander did not attempt to impose uniform imperial coinage throughout his new conquests. Persian coins continued to circulate in all the satrapies of the empire.[124]

Indian campaign

Forays into the Indian subcontinent

Alexander's invasion of the Indian subcontinent

After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Raoxshna in Old Iranian) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent. He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara (a region presently straddling eastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan), to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis (Indian name Ambhi), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of ""Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1,000 talents in gold"". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund,[126] supplied their troops with provisions, and he received Alexander and his whole army in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality.

The Phalanx Attacking the Centre in the Battle of the Hydaspes by André Castaigne (1898–1899)

On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5,000 men and took part in the Battle of the Hydaspes. After that victory, he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; Taxiles contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes and was entrusted by Alexander with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas, and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC.

In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against the Aspasioi of the Kunar Valley, the Guraeans of the Guraeus Valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner Valleys.[127] A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi who fought against him from the strongholds of Massaga, Ora, and Aornos.

The fort of Massaga was reduced after days of bloody fighting in which Alexander was seriously wounded in the ankle. According to Curtius, ""Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble.""[128] A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.

Porus surrenders to Alexander

After Aornos, Alexander crossed the Indus and won an epic battle against King Porus, who ruled a region lying between the Hydaspes and the Acesines (Chenab), in what is now the Punjab, in the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC. Alexander was impressed by Porus's bravery and made him an ally. He appointed Porus as satrap, and added to Porus's territory land that he did not previously own, towards the south-east, up to the Hyphasis (Beas).[130][131] Choosing a local helped him control these lands that were distant from Greece. Alexander founded two cities on opposite sides of the Hydaspes river, naming one Bucephala, in honour of his horse, who died around this time. The other was Nicaea (Victory), thought to be located at the site of modern-day Mong, Punjab.[134] Philostratus the Elder in the Life of Apollonius of Tyana writes that in the army of Porus, there was an elephant who fought bravely against Alexander's army, and Alexander dedicated it to the Helios (Sun) and named it Ajax because he thought that such a great animal deserved a great name. The elephant had gold rings around its tusks and an inscription was on them written in Greek: ""Alexander the son of Zeus dedicates Ajax to the Helios"" (ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΣ Ο ΔΙΟΣ ΤΟΝ ΑΙΑΝΤΑ ΤΩΙ ΗΛΙΩΙ).[135]

Revolt of the Hellenic army

Asia in 323 BC, the Nanda Empire and the Gangaridai of the Indian subcontinent, in relation to Alexander's Empire and neighbours

East of Porus's kingdom, near the Ganges River, was the Nanda Empire of Magadha, and further east, the Gangaridai Empire of Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent. Fearing the prospect of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning, Alexander's army mutinied at the Hyphasis River (Beas), refusing to march farther east. This river thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander's conquests.

As for the Macedonians, however, their struggle with Porus blunted their courage and stayed their further advance into India. For having had all they could do to repulse an enemy who mustered only twenty thousand infantry and two thousand horse, they violently opposed Alexander when he insisted on crossing the river Ganges also, the width of which, as they learned, was thirty-two furlongs [6.4 km], its depth one hundred fathoms [180 m], while its banks on the further side were covered with multitudes of men-at-arms and horsemen and elephants. For they were told that the kings of the Ganderites and Praesii were awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen, two hundred thousand footmen, eight thousand chariots, and six thousand war elephants.[138]

Alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther, but his general Coenus pleaded with him to change his opinion and return; the men, he said, ""longed to again see their parents, their wives and children, their homeland"". Alexander eventually agreed and turned south, marching along the Indus. Along the way his army conquered the Malhi (in modern-day Multan) and other Indian tribes; while besieging the Mallian citadel, Alexander suffered a near-fatal injury when an arrow penetrated his armor and entered his lung.[140]

Alexander sent much of his army to Carmania (modern southern Iran) with general Craterus, and commissioned a fleet to explore the Persian Gulf shore under his admiral Nearchus, while he led the rest back to Persia through the more difficult southern route along the Gedrosian Desert and Makran. Alexander reached Susa in 324 BC, but not before losing many men to the harsh desert.[142]

Last years in Persia

Stag Hunt Mosaic, the figure on the right possibly being Alexander, and the figure to the left wields a double-headed axe, likely alluding to Hephaistos; possibly meaning his general Hephaestion

Discovering that many of his satraps and military governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to Susa.[143][144] As a gesture of thanks, he paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would send over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon, led by Craterus. His troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of Opis. They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units.[145]

After three days, unable to persuade his men to back down, Alexander gave Persians command posts in the army and conferred Macedonian military titles upon Persian units. The Macedonians quickly begged forgiveness, which Alexander accepted, and held a great banquet with several thousand of his men.[146] In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, Alexander held a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year.[144]

Meanwhile, upon his return to Persia, Alexander learned that guards of the tomb of Cyrus the Great in Pasargadae had desecrated it, and swiftly executed them.[147] Alexander admired Cyrus the Great, from an early age reading Xenophon's Cyropaedia, which described Cyrus's heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator.[148] During his visit to Pasargadae, Alexander ordered his architect Aristobulus to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of Cyrus's tomb.[148]

Afterwards, Alexander travelled to Ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the Persian treasure. There, his closest friend, Hephaestion, died of illness or poisoning.[149] Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander and he ordered the preparation of an expensive funeral pyre in Babylon along with a decree for public mourning.[149] Back in Babylon, Alexander planned a series of new campaigns, beginning with an invasion of Arabia.[150]

Death and succession

On either 10 or 11 June 323 BC, Alexander died in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age 32.[151][152] There are two different versions of Alexander's death, differing slightly in details. Plutarch's account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa.[153] Alexander developed a fever, which worsened until he was unable to speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them. In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever, instead dying after some agony.[155] Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.[153]

Given the propensity of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination, foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mentioned the theory that Alexander was poisoned. Justin stated that Alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication,[157] while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness.[155][158] The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater, recently removed as Macedonian viceroy, replaced by Craterus, as the head of the alleged plot.[159] Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas,[161] Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer.[158][161] There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.[158] The strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death; such long-acting poisons were probably not available. However, in a 2003 BBC documentary investigating the death of Alexander, Leo Schep from the New Zealand National Poisons Centre proposed that the plant white hellebore (Veratrum album), which was known in antiquity, may have been used to poison Alexander.[163][165] In a 2014 manuscript in the journal Clinical Toxicology, Schep suggested Alexander's wine was spiked with Veratrum album, and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the Alexander Romance.[166] Veratrum album poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if Alexander was poisoned, Veratrum album offers the most plausible cause.[166][167] Another poisoning explanation put forward in 2010 proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river Styx (modern-day Mavroneri in Arcadia, Greece) that contained calicheamicin, a dangerous compound produced by bacteria.[168]

Several natural causes (diseases) have been suggested, including malaria and typhoid fever. A 1998 article in the New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis.[169] A 2004 analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) spondylitis or meningitis.[170] Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including acute pancreatitis, West Nile virus,[171][172] and Guillain-Barré syndrome.[173] Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.[169]

Post-death events

Alexander's body was laid in a gold anthropoid sarcophagus that was filled with honey, which was in turn placed in a gold casket.[174][175] According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest ""would be happy and unvanquishable forever"".[176] Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative.

19th-century depiction of Alexander's funeral procession, based on the description by Diodorus Siculus

While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis.[174][176] His successor, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least late antiquity. Ptolemy IX Lathyros, one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage.[178] The 2014 discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece, at Amphipolis, dating from the time of Alexander the Great[179] has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege. However, the memorial was found to be dedicated to the dearest friend of Alexander the Great, Hephaestion.[180][181]

Detail of Alexander on the Alexander Sarcophagus

Pompey, Julius Caesar and Augustus all visited the tomb in Alexandria where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose of Alexander's mummified body off. Caligula was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. Around AD 200, Emperor Septimius Severus closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, Caracalla, a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy.[178]

The so-called ""Alexander Sarcophagus"", discovered near Sidon and now in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of Abdalonymus (died 311 BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the battle of Issus in 331.[182][183] However, in 1969, it was suggested by Karl Schefold that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymus's death.[184]

Demades likened the Macedonian army, after the death of Alexander, to the blinded Cyclops due to the many random and disorderly movements that it made.[185][186][187] In addition, Leosthenes also likened the anarchy between the generals, after Alexander's death, to the blinded Cyclops ""who after he had lost his eye went feeling and groping about with his hands before him, not knowing where to lay them"".[188]

Division of the Macedonian Empire

Alexander's death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached Greece, they were not immediately believed.[65] Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death. According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was ""tôi kratistôi""—""to the strongest"".[155] Another theory is that his successors wilfully or erroneously misheard ""tôi Kraterôi""—""to Craterus"", the general leading his Macedonian troops home and newly entrusted with the regency of Macedonia.[190]

Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this time, implying that this was an apocryphal story.[191] Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him.[155]

Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male, with himself, Craterus, Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, under the command of Meleager, rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only.

Dissension and rivalry soon affected the Macedonians. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the Partition of Babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321 BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40 years of war between ""The Successors"" (Diadochi) ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into three stable power blocs: Ptolemaic Egypt, Seleucid Syria and East, and Antigonid Macedonia. In the process, both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered.

Last plans

Diodorus stated that Alexander had given detailed written instructions to Craterus some time before his death, which are known as Alexander's ""last plans"".[194] Craterus started to carry out Alexander's commands, but the successors chose not to further implement them, on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant.[194] Furthermore, Perdiccas had read the notebooks containing Alexander's last plans to the Macedonian troops in Babylon, who voted not to carry them out.[65]

According to Diodorus, Alexander's last plans called for military expansion into the southern and western Mediterranean, monumental constructions, and the intermixing of Eastern and Western populations. It included:

The enormous scale of these plans has led many scholars to doubt their historicity. Ernst Badian argued that they were exaggerated by Perdiccas in order to ensure that the Macedonian troops voted not to carry them out.[195] Other scholars have proposed that they were invented by later authors within the tradition of the Alexander Romance.[197]

Character

Generalship

Alexander perhaps earned the epithet ""the Great"" due to his unparalleled success as a military commander; he never lost a battle, despite typically being outnumbered. This was due to use of terrain, phalanx and cavalry tactics, bold strategy, and the fierce loyalty of his troops.[199] The Macedonian phalanx, armed with the sarissa, a spear 6 metres (20 ft) long, had been developed and perfected by Philip II through rigorous training, and Alexander used its speed and manoeuvrability to great effect against larger but more disparate Persian forces. Alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse army, which employed various languages and weapons. He overcame this by being personally involved in battle, in the manner of a Macedonian king.[199]

In his first battle in Asia, at Granicus, Alexander used only a small part of his forces, perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry, against a much larger Persian force of 40,000.[201] Alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings, so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line, about 3 km (1.86 mi). By contrast, the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry. This ensured that Alexander would not be outflanked, while his phalanx, armed with long pikes, had a considerable advantage over the Persians' scimitars and javelins. Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians.

At Issus in 333 BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through. Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army. At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius's center, causing the latter to flee once again.

When faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques, such as in Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. Thus, in Bactria and Sogdiana, Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center. In India, confronted by Porus's elephant corps, the Macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants' handlers.[146]

Physical appearance

Alexander cameo by Pyrgoteles

Historical sources frequently give conflicting accounts of Alexander's appearance, and the earliest sources are the most scant in their detail.[204] During his lifetime, Alexander carefully curated his image by commissioning works from famous and great artists of the time. This included commissioning sculptures by Lysippos, paintings by Apelles and gem engravings by Pyrgoteles.[205] Ancient authors recorded that Alexander was so pleased with portraits of himself created by Lysippos that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image; scholars today, however, find the claim dubious.[206][205] Nevertheless, Andrew Stewart highlights the fact that artistic portraits, not least because of who they are commissioned by, are always partisan, and that artistic portrayals of Alexander ""seek to legitimize him (or, by extension, his Successors), to interpret him to their audiences, to answer their critiques, and to persuade them of his greatness"", and thus should be considered within a framework of ""praise and blame"", in the same way sources such as praise poetry are.[207] Despite those caveats, Lysippos's sculpture, famous for its naturalism, as opposed to a stiffer, more static pose, is thought to be the most faithful depiction.

Curtius Rufus, a Roman historian from the first century AD, who wrote the Histories of Alexander the Great, gives this account of Alexander sitting on the throne of Darius III:

Then Alexander seating himself on the royal throne, which was far too high for his bodily stature. Therefore, since his feet did not reach its lowest step, one of the royal pages placed a table under his feet.

Both Curtius and Diodorus report a story that when Darius III's mother, Sisygambis, first met Alexander and Hephaestion, she assumed that the latter was Alexander because he was the taller and more handsome of the two.[210]

Alexander sculpture by Lysippos (4th century BC)

The Greek biographer Plutarch ( c. 45 – c. 120 AD) discusses the accuracy of his depictions:

The outward appearance of Alexander is best represented by the statues of him which Lysippus made, and it was by this artist alone that Alexander himself thought it fit that he should be modelled. For those peculiarities which many of his successors and friends afterwards tried to imitate, namely, the poise of the neck, which was bent slightly to the left, and the melting glance of his eyes, this artist has accurately observed. Apelles, however, in painting him as wielder of the thunder-bolt, did not reproduce his complexion, but made it too dark and swarthy. Whereas he was of a fair colour, as they say, and his fairness passed into ruddiness on his breast particularly, and in his face. Moreover, that a very pleasant odour exhaled from his skin and that there was a fragrance about his mouth and all his flesh, so that his garments were filled with it, this we have read in the Memoirs of Aristoxenus.

Historians have understood the detail of the pleasant fragrance attributed to Alexander as stemming from a belief in ancient Greece that pleasant scents are characteristic of gods and heroes.[205]

The Alexander Mosaic and contemporary coins portray Alexander with ""a straight nose, a slightly protruding jaw, full lips and eyes deep set beneath a strongly pronounced forehead"".[205] He is also described as having a slight upward tilt of his head to the left.

The ancient historian Aelian ( c. 175 – c. 235 AD), in his Varia Historia (12.14), describes Alexander's hair color as ""ξανθὴν"" (xanthín), which at the time, could mean blond, brown, tawny (light brown) or auburn.[214][215] It is sometimes claimed that Alexander had one blue and one brown eye,[216] referring to the Alexander Romance, which is however a fictional account that also claims Alexander ""had sharp teeth like fangs"" and ""did not look like Philip or Olympias"". Reconstruction, based on remaining traces of paint of the original polychromy on his sarcophagus, indicates that he was depicted with brown eyes and chestnut brown hair.[217] While the acropolis museum suggests that trace amounts of red paint on a head statue of Alexander were most likely a base coat for golden hues to be painted over for his hair.[218]

Personality

Both of Alexander's parents encouraged his ambitions. His father Philip was probably Alexander's most immediate and influential role model, as the young Alexander watched him campaign practically every year, winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds. Alexander's relationship with his father ""forged"" the competitive side of his personality; he had a need to outdo his father, illustrated by his reckless behavior in battle. While Alexander worried that his father would leave him ""no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world"",[221] he also downplayed his father's achievements to his companions. Alexander's mother Olympia similarly had huge ambitions, and encouraged her son to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire. She instilled a sense of destiny in him, and Plutarch tells how his ambition ""kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years"".[223]

According to Plutarch, Alexander also had a violent temper and rash, impulsive nature,[224] which could influence his decision making. Although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father, he was open to reasoned debate.[225] He had a calmer side—perceptive, logical, and calculating. He had a great desire for knowledge, a love for philosophy, and was an avid reader.[226] This was no doubt in part due to Aristotle's tutelage; Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn. His intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general.[224] He had great self-restraint in ""pleasures of the body"", in contrast with his lack of self-control with alcohol.[227]

Alexander was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences.[223][226] However, he had little interest in sports or the Olympic Games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos).[228] He had great charisma and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader.[224] His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander had the ability to do so.

During his final years, and especially after the death of Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia. His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect. His delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world, in as much as he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition,[230][231] an epithet, the meaning of which has descended into a historical cliché.[232][233]

He appears to have believed himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself. Olympias always insisted to him that he was the son of Zeus,[234] a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at Siwa.[235] He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon.[235] Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis, which was one aspect of Alexander's broad strategy aimed at securing the aid and support of the Iranian upper classes; however the practise of proskynesis was disapproved by the Macedonians, and they were unwilling to perform it.[110] This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen.[236] Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in societies where the king was treated as divine.[237] Thus, rather than megalomania, his behaviour may have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.[238]

Personal relationships

Alexander married three times: Roxana, daughter of the Sogdian nobleman Oxyartes of Bactria,[239][240][241] out of love; and the Persian princesses Stateira and Parysatis, the former a daughter of Darius III and the latter a daughter of Artaxerxes III, for political reasons.[243] Alexander apparently had two children by Roxana: unnamed first child, who was born in India and died in infancy in November 326 BC,[245] and Alexander IV of Macedon, born after his father's death. Additionaly Heracles of Macedon was claimed to be his illegitimate son born of mistress, Barsine.

Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend, general, and bodyguard Hephaestion, the son of a Macedonian noble.[149][246] Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander.[149][247] This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached mental state during his final months.[169]

Sexuality

Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy in modern times. The Roman era writer Athenaeus says, based on the scholar Dicaearchus, who was Alexander's contemporary, that the king ""was quite excessively keen on boys"", and that Alexander kissed the eunuch Bagoas in public.[249] This episode is also told by Plutarch, probably based on the same source. None of Alexander's contemporaries, however, are known to have explicitly described Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion as sexual, though the pair was often compared to Achilles and Patroclus, who are often interpreted as a couple. Aelian writes of Alexander's visit to Troy where ""Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles, and Hephaestion that of Patroclus, the latter hinting that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles.""[250] Some modern historians (e.g., Robin Lane Fox) believe not only that Alexander's youthful relationship with Hephaestion was sexual, but also that their sexual contacts may have continued into adulthood, which went against the social norms of at least some Greek cities, such as Athens,[251] though some modern researchers have tentatively proposed that Macedonia (or at least the Macedonian court) may have been more tolerant of homosexuality between adults.[253]

Alexander and his general Hephaestion, at the Getty Villa

Peter Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much sexual interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life. However, Ogden calculates that Alexander, who impregnated his partners thrice in eight years, had a higher matrimonial record than his father at the same age. Two of these pregnancies—Stateira's and Barsine's—are of dubious legitimacy.[255]

According to Diodorus Siculus, Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly, ""not wishing to offend the Macedonians"",[256] showing great self-control in ""pleasures of the body"".[227] Nevertheless, Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her.[257] Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, including Ada of Caria, who adopted him, and even Darius's mother Sisygambis, who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death.

Battle record

Legacy

Alexander's legacy extended beyond his military conquests, and his reign marked a turning point in European and Asian history.[258] His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West, and vast areas to the east were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves got a sense of belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean.

Hellenistic kingdoms

Alexander's most immediate legacy was the introduction of Macedonian rule to huge new swathes of Asia. At the time of his death, Alexander's empire covered some 5,200,000 km2 (2,000,000 sq mi),[260] and was the largest state of its time. Many of these areas remained in Macedonian hands or under Greek influence for the next 200–300 years. The successor states that emerged were, at least initially, dominant forces, and these 300 years are often referred to as the Hellenistic period.

The eastern borders of Alexander's empire began to collapse even during his lifetime. However, the power vacuum he left in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent directly gave rise to one of the most powerful Indian dynasties in history, the Maurya Empire. Taking advantage of this power vacuum, Chandragupta Maurya (referred to in Greek sources as ""Sandrokottos""), of relatively humble origin, took control of the Punjab, and with that power base proceeded to conquer the Nanda Empire.

Founding of cities

Plan of Alexandria c. 30 BC

Over the course of his conquests, Alexander founded many cities that bore his name, most of them east of the Tigris.[263] The first, and greatest, was Alexandria in Egypt, which would become one of the leading Mediterranean cities. The cities' locations reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions. At first, the cities must have been inhospitable, little more than defensive garrisons. Following Alexander's death, many Greeks who had settled there tried to return to Greece.[263] However, a century or so after Alexander's death, many of the Alexandrias were thriving, with elaborate public buildings and substantial populations that included both Greek and local peoples.

Funding of temples

In 334 BC, Alexander the Great donated funds for the completion of the new temple of Athena Polias in Priene, in modern-day western Turkey.[265] An inscription from the temple, now housed in the British Museum, declares: ""King Alexander dedicated [this temple] to Athena Polias.""[264] This inscription is one of the few independent archaeological discoveries confirming an episode from Alexander's life.[264] The temple was designed by Pytheos, one of the architects of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus.[264][265][266]

Libanius wrote that Alexander founded the temple of Zeus Bottiaios (Ancient Greek: Βοττιαίου Δῖός), in the place where later the city of Antioch was built.[267][268]

Suda wrote that Alexander built a big temple to Sarapis.[269]

In 2023, British Museum experts have suggested the possibility that a Greek temple at Girsu in Iraq, was founded by Alexander. According to the researchers, recent discoveries suggest that ""this site honours Zeus and two divine sons. The sons are Heracles and Alexander.""[270]

Hellenization

Alexander's empire was the largest state of its time, covering approximately 5.2 million square km.

Hellenization was coined by the German historian Johann Gustav Droysen to denote the spread of Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest. This process can be seen in such great Hellenistic cities as Alexandria, Antioch and Seleucia (south of modern Baghdad).[272] Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into Persian culture and to hybridize Greek and Persian culture, homogenizing the populations of Asia and Europe. Although his successors explicitly rejected such policies, Hellenization occurred throughout the region, accompanied by a distinct and opposite 'Orientalization' of the successor states.

The core of the Hellenistic culture promulgated by the conquests was essentially Athenian.[274] The close association of men from across Greece in Alexander's army directly led to the emergence of the largely Attic-based ""koine"", or ""common"" Greek dialect. Koine spread throughout the Hellenistic world, becoming the lingua franca of Hellenistic lands, and eventually the ancestor of modern Greek. Furthermore, town planning, education, local government, and art current in the Hellenistic period were all based on Classical Greek ideals, evolving into distinct new forms commonly grouped as Hellenistic. Also, the New Testament was written in the Koine Greek language. Aspects of Hellenistic culture were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century.[276]

Hellenization in South and Central Asia

Some of the most pronounced effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-rising Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250–125 BC) (in modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan) and the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BC – 10 AD) in modern Afghanistan and India. On the Silk Road trade routes, Hellenistic culture hybridized with Iranian and Buddhist cultures. The cosmopolitan art and mythology of Gandhara (a region spanning the upper confluence of the Indus, Swat and Kabul rivers in modern Pakistan) of the ~3rd century BC to the ~5th century AD are most evident of the direct contact between Hellenistic civilization and South Asia, as are the Edicts of Ashoka, which directly mention the Greeks within Ashoka's dominion as converting to Buddhism and the reception of Buddhist emissaries by Ashoka's contemporaries in the Hellenistic world.[278] The resulting syncretism known as Greco-Buddhism influenced the development of Buddhism[279] and created a culture of Greco-Buddhist art. These Greco-Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China, Sri Lanka and Hellenistic Asia and Europe (Greco-Buddhist monasticism).

Some of the first and most influential figurative portrayals of The Buddha appeared at this time, perhaps modelled on Greek statues of Apollo in the Greco-Buddhist style. Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion: the concept of Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes,[281] and some Mahayana ceremonial practices (burning incense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practised by the ancient Greeks; however, similar practices were also observed amongst the native Indic culture. One Greek king, Menander I, probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as 'Milinda'. The process of Hellenization also spurred trade between the east and west.[282] For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the Greco-Bactrian city of Ai Khanoum in modern-day Afghanistan,[283] while the Greek concept of a spherical Earth surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain (Mount Meru) like the petals of a flower.[282][284][285] The Yavanajataka (lit. Greek astronomical treatise) and Paulisa Siddhanta texts depict the influence of Greek astronomical ideas on Indian astronomy.

Following the conquests of Alexander the Great in the east, Hellenistic influence on Indian art was far-reaching. In architecture, a few examples of the Ionic order can be found as far as Pakistan with the Jandial temple near Taxila. Several examples of capitals displaying Ionic influences can be seen as far as Patna, especially with the Pataliputra capital, dated to the 3rd century BC.[286] The Corinthian order is also heavily represented in the art of Gandhara, especially through Indo-Corinthian capitals.

Influence on Rome

Alexander and his exploits were admired by many Romans, especially generals, who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements.[287] Polybius began his Histories by reminding Romans of Alexander's achievements, and thereafter Roman leaders saw him as a role model. Pompey the Great adopted the epithet ""Magnus"" and even Alexander's anastole-type haircut, and searched the conquered lands of the east for Alexander's 260-year-old cloak, which he then wore as a sign of greatness.[287] Julius Caesar dedicated a Lysippean equestrian bronze statue, but replaced Alexander's head with his own, while Octavian visited Alexander's tomb in Alexandria and temporarily changed his seal from a sphinx to Alexander's profile.[287] The emperor Trajan also admired Alexander, as did Nero and Caracalla.[287] The Macriani, a Roman family that in the person of Macrinus briefly ascended to the imperial throne, kept images of Alexander on their persons, either on jewellery or embroidered into their clothes.

On the other hand, some Roman writers, particularly Republican figures, used Alexander as a cautionary tale of how autocratic tendencies can be kept in check by republican values.[289] Alexander was used by these writers as an example of ruler values such as amicitia (friendship) and clementia (clemency), but also iracundia (anger) and cupiditas gloriae (over-desire for glory).[289]

Emperor Julian in his satire called ""The Caesars"", describes a contest between the previous Roman emperors, with Alexander the Great called in as an extra contestant, in the presence of the assembled gods.[290]

The Itinerarium Alexandri is a 4th-century Latin description of Alexander the Great's campaigns. Julius Caesar went to serve his quaestorship in Hispania after his wife's funeral, in the spring or early summer of 69 BC. While there, he encountered a statue of Alexander the Great, and realised with dissatisfaction that he was now at an age when Alexander had the world at his feet, while he had achieved comparatively little.[291][292]

Pompey posed as the ""new Alexander"" since he was his boyhood hero.[293]

After Caracalla concluded his campaign against the Alamanni, it became evident that he was inordinately preoccupied with Alexander the Great.[294][295] He began openly mimicking Alexander in his personal style. In planning his invasion of the Parthian Empire, Caracalla decided to arrange 16,000 of his men in Macedonian-style phalanxes, despite the Roman army having made the phalanx an obsolete tactical formation.[294][295][296] The historian Christopher Matthew mentions that the term Phalangarii has two possible meanings, both with military connotations. The first refers merely to the Roman battle line and does not specifically mean that the men were armed with pikes, and the second bears similarity to the 'Marian Mules' of the late Roman Republic who carried their equipment suspended from a long pole, which were in use until at least the 2nd century AD.[296] As a consequence, the Phalangarii of Legio II Parthica may not have been pikemen, but rather standard battle line troops or possibly Triarii.[296]

Caracalla's mania for Alexander went so far that Caracalla visited Alexandria while preparing for his Persian invasion and persecuted philosophers of the Aristotelian school based on a legend that Aristotle had poisoned Alexander. This was a sign of Caracalla's increasingly erratic behaviour. But this mania for Alexander, strange as it was, was overshadowed by subsequent events in Alexandria.[295]

In 39, Caligula performed a spectacular stunt by ordering a temporary floating bridge to be built using ships as pontoons, stretching for over two miles from the resort of Baiae to the neighbouring port of Puteoli.[297][298] It was said that the bridge was to rival the Persian king Xerxes' pontoon bridge crossing of the Hellespont.[298] Caligula, who could not swim,[299] then proceeded to ride his favourite horse Incitatus across, wearing the breastplate of Alexander the Great.[298] This act was in defiance of a prediction by Tiberius's soothsayer Thrasyllus of Mendes that Caligula had ""no more chance of becoming emperor than of riding a horse across the Bay of Baiae"".[298]

The diffusion of Greek culture and language cemented by Alexander's conquests in West Asia and North Africa served as a ""precondition"" for the later Roman expansion into these territories and entire basis for the Byzantine Empire, according to Errington.[300]

Letters

Alexander wrote and received numerous letters, but no originals survive. A few official letters addressed to the Greek cities survive in copies inscribed in stone and the content of others is sometimes reported in historical sources. These only occasionally quote the letters and it is an open question how reliable such quotations are. Several fictitious letters, some perhaps based on actual letters, made their way into the Romance tradition.[301]

In legend

Alexander in a 14th-century Armenian manuscript

Many of the legends about Alexander derive from his own lifetime, probably encouraged by Alexander himself. His court historian Callisthenes portrayed the sea in Cilicia as drawing back from him in proskynesis. Writing shortly after Alexander's death, Onesicritus invented a tryst between Alexander and Thalestris, queen of the mythical Amazons. He reportedly read this passage to his patron King Lysimachus, who had been one of Alexander's generals and who quipped, ""I wonder where I was at the time.""[303]

In the first centuries after Alexander's death, probably in Alexandria, a quantity of the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the Alexander Romance, later falsely ascribed to Callisthenes and therefore known as Pseudo-Callisthenes. This text underwent over one hundred recensions, translations, and derivations throughout the Islamic and European worlds in premodern times,[304] containing many dubious stories, and was translated into twenty-five languages, for example Middle Persian, Syriac and Arabic.[306][8]

In ancient and modern culture

Alexander in a 14th-century Byzantine manuscript

Alexander the Great's accomplishments and legacy have been depicted in many cultures. Alexander has featured in both high and popular culture, beginning from his own era to the present day. The Alexander Romance, in particular, has had a significant impact on portrayals of Alexander in later cultures, from Persian to medieval European, to modern Greek.

Alexander features prominently in modern Greek folklore, more than any other ancient figure.[307] The colloquial form of his name in modern Greek (""O Megalexandros"") is a household name, and he is the only ancient hero to appear in the Karagiozis shadow play.[307] One well-known fable among Greek seamen involves a solitary mermaid who would grasp a ship's prow during a storm and ask the captain, ""Is King Alexander alive?"" The answer should be ""He is alive and well and rules the world!"" causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm. Any other answer would cause the mermaid to turn into a raging Gorgon who would drag the ship to the bottom of the sea, all hands aboard.[307]

Folio from the Shahnameh showing Alexander praying at the Kaaba, mid-16th century

In pre-Islamic Middle Persian (Zoroastrian) literature, Alexander is referred to by the epithet gujastak, meaning ""accursed"", and is accused of destroying temples and burning the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism.[308] In Islamic Persia, under the influence of the Alexander Romance (in Persian: اسکندرنامه Iskandarnameh), a more positive portrayal of Alexander emerges. Firdausi's Shahnameh (""The Book of Kings"") includes Alexander in a line of legitimate Persian shahs, a mythical figure who explored the far reaches of the world in search of the Fountain of Youth.[310] In the Shahnameh, Alexander's first journey is to Mecca to pray at the Kaaba.[311] Alexander was depicted as performing a Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca) many times in subsequent Islamic art and literature.[312] Later Persian writers associate him with philosophy, portraying him at a symposium with figures such as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, in search of immortality.

The figure of Dhu al-Qarnayn (Arabic: ذو القرنين; lit. ""The Two-Horned One"") is believed by the majority of modern researchers of the Qur'an as well as Islamic commentators to be a reference to Alexander.[313] The figure is also believed by scholars to be based on later legends of Alexander. In this tradition, he was a heroic figure who built a wall to defend against the nations of Gog and Magog. He also travelled the known world in search of the Water of Life and Immortality, eventually becoming a prophet.

The Syriac version of the Alexander Romance portrays him as an ideal Christian world conqueror who prayed to ""the one true God"". In Egypt, Alexander was portrayed as the son of Nectanebo II, the last pharaoh before the Persian conquest. His defeat of Darius was depicted as Egypt's salvation, ""proving"" Egypt was still ruled by an Egyptian.

According to Josephus, Alexander was shown the Book of Daniel when he entered Jerusalem, which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire. This is cited as a reason for sparing Jerusalem.[315]

In Hindi and Urdu, the name ""Sikandar"", derived from the Persian name for Alexander, denotes a rising young talent, and the Delhi Sultanate ruler Alauddin Khalji stylized himself as ""Sikandar-i-Sani"" (the Second Alexander the Great).[316] In medieval India, Turkic and Afghan sovereigns from the Iranian-cultured region of Central Asia brought positive cultural connotations of Alexander to the Indian subcontinent, resulting in the efflorescence of Sikandernameh (Alexander Romances) written by Indo-Persian poets such as Amir Khusrau and the prominence of Alexander the Great as a popular subject in Mughal-era Persian miniatures.[317] In medieval Europe, Alexander the Great was revered as a member of the Nine Worthies; a group of heroes whose lives were believed to encapsulate all the ideal qualities of chivalry.[318] During the first Italian campaign of the French Revolutionary Wars, in a question from Bourrienne, asking whether he gave his preference to Alexander or Caesar, Napoleon said that he places Alexander The Great in the first rank, the main reason being his campaign on Asia.[319]

In the Greek Anthology, there are poems referring to Alexander.[320][321]

Throughout time, art objects related to Alexander were being created. In addition to speech works, sculptures and paintings, in modern times Alexander is still the subject of musical and cinematic works. The song 'Alexander the Great' by the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden is indicative. Some films that have been shot with the theme of Alexander are:

There are also many references to other movies and TV series.

Newer novels about Alexander are: The trilogy ""Alexander the Great"" by Valerio Massimo Manfredi consisting of ""The son of the dream"", ""The sand of Amon"", and ""The ends of the world"". The trilogy of Mary Renault consisting of ""Fire from Heaven"", ""The Persian Boy"" and ""Funeral Games"".

Irish playwright Aubrey Thomas de Vere wrote Alexander the Great, a Dramatic Poem.

Historiography

Apart from a few inscriptions and fragments, texts written by people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander were all lost. Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander's campaign historian Callisthenes, Alexander's generals; Ptolemy and Nearchus, Aristobulus, a junior officer on the campaigns, and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief helmsman. Their works are lost, but later works based on these original sources have survived. The earliest of these is Diodorus Siculus (1st century BC), followed by Quintus Curtius Rufus (mid-to-late 1st century AD), Arrian (1st to 2nd century AD), the biographer Plutarch (1st to 2nd century AD), and finally Justin, whose work dated as late as the 4th century. Of these, Arrian is generally considered the most reliable, given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources, closely followed by Diodorus.

The ultimate aim of history 
is human self-knowledge. In the words of 20th-century 
historian R. G. Collingwood: “The value of history is that it teaches  us what man has done and thus what man is.” We cannot hope to understand our lives without it.
History itself has a history. From 
earliest times, all societies—literate or pre-literate—told stories about their origins or their past, usually imaginative tales centering around the acts of gods and heroes. The first literate civilizations also kept records of the actions of their rulers, inscribed on clay tablets or on the walls of palaces and temples. But  at first these ancient societies made no attempt at a systematic inquiry into the truth of the past; they did not differentiate between what had really happened and the events manifest in myth and legend.
Ancient historical narrative
It was the Ancient Greek writers Herodotus and Thucydides in the 5th century 
bce who first explored 
questions about the past through the collection and interpretation of evidence—the word “history,” first used by Herodotus, means “inquiry” in Greek. Herodotus’s work still contained a considerable mixture of myth, but Thucydides’ account of the Peloponnesian War satisfies most criteria of modern historical study. It was based on interviews with eyewitnesses of the conflict and attributed events to human agency rather than the intervention and actions of the gods. 
Thucydides had invented one  
of the most durable forms of history: the detailed narrative of war and political conflict, diplomacy, and decision-making. The subsequent rise of Rome to dominance of the Mediterranean world encouraged historians to develop another genre of broader scope: the account of “how we got to where we are today.” The Hellenic historian Polybius  
(200–118 
bce) and the Roman 
historian Livy (59 bce–17 ce) both sought to create a narrative of the rise of Rome—a “big picture” that would help to make sense of events on a large timescale. Although restricted to the Roman world, this was the beginning of what is sometimes called “universal history,” which attempts to describe progress from earliest origins to the present as a story with a goal, giving the past apparent purpose and direction. 
At the same period in China, 
historian Sima Qian (c.145–86 
bce) 
was similarly tracing Chinese history over thousands of years, from the legendary Yellow Emperor (c.2697 
bce) to the Han dynasty 
under Emperor Wu (c.109 bce).
Moral lessons
As well as making sense of events through narratives, historians in the ancient world established the tradition of history as a source of moral lessons and reflections. The history writing of Livy or Tacitus (56–117 
ce), for instance, was in part 
designed to examine the behavior of heroes and villains, meditating  
on the strengths and weaknesses in the characters of emperors and generals, providing exemplars for the virtuous to imitate or shun. This continues to be one of the functions of history. French chronicler Jean Froissart (1337–1405) said he had INTRODUCTION
Those who cannot
remember the past are 
condemned to repeat it. 
George Santayana
The Life of Reason  (1905)

written his accounts of chivalrous knights fighting in the Hundred Years’ War “so that brave men should be inspired thereby to follow such examples.” Today, historical studies of Lincoln, Churchill, Gandhi, or Martin Luther King, Jr. perform the same function. 
The “Dark Ages”
The rise of Christianity in the late Roman Empire fundamentally changed the concept of history in Europe. Historical events came to be viewed by Christians as divine providence, or the working out of God’s will. Skeptical inquiry into what actually happened was usually neglected, and accounts of miracles and martyrdoms were generally accepted as true without question. The Muslim world, in this as in other ways, was frequently more sophisticated than Christendom  in Medieval times, with the Arab historian Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) railing against the blind, uncritical acceptance of fanciful accounts of events that could not be verified. 
Neither Christian nor Muslim

Whatever the undoubted merits  of other civilizations’ traditions of history writing, it was in Western Europe that modern historiography evolved. The Renaissance—which began in Italy in the 15th century, then spread throughout Europe  lasting until the end of the 16th century in some areas—centered upon the rediscovery of the past. Renaissance thinkers found a fertile source of inspiration in classical antiquity, in areas as diverse as architecture, philosophy, politics, and military tactics.

The Enlightenment
By the 18th century in Europe, the methodology of history—which consisted of ascertaining facts by criticizing and comparing historical sources—had reached a fair level of sophistication. European thinkers had reached general agreement on the division of the past into three main periods: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern. This periodization was at root a value judgment, with the Medieval period, dominated  by the Church, viewed as a time  of irrationality and barbarism and separating the dignified world of the ancient civilizations from the newly emerging, rational universe of modern Europe. Enlightenment philosophers wrote histories that ridiculed the follies of the past. 
The Romantic spirit
In stark contrast, the Romantic movement that swept across Europe from the late 18th century found  an intrinsic value in the difference between the past and the present.

The “Dark Ages”
The rise of Christianity in the late Roman Empire fundamentally changed the concept of history in Europe. Historical events came to be viewed by Christians as divine providence, or the working out of God’s will. Skeptical inquiry into what actually happened was usually neglected, and accounts of miracles and martyrdoms were generally accepted as true without question. The Muslim world, in this as in other ways, was frequently more sophisticated than Christendom  in Medieval times, with the Arab historian Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) railing against the blind, uncritical acceptance of fanciful accounts of events that could not be verified.

The Romantics drew inspiration from 
the Middle Ages, and instead of seeing the past as a preparation for the modern world, as had previously been the case, Romantic historians tried the imaginative exercise of entering into the spirit of past ages. Much of this was associated with nationalism. The German Romantic thinker Johann Gottfried Herder (1774–1803) burrowed into the past in search of roots of national identity and an authentic “German spirit.” As nationalism triumphed in Europe in the 19th century, much of history became a celebration of national characteristics and national heroes, often veering into myth-making. Every country wanted to have its sacred heroic history, just as it had its flag and its national anthem.  
The “Grand Narrative” 
In the 19th century, history became increasingly important and took on the quality of destiny. Arrogantly, European civilization saw itself as the goal to which all history had been progressing and constructed narratives that made sense of the past in those terms. The German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) articulated a grand scheme of history as a logical development, which culminated in the end point of the Prussian state. Philosopher and social revolutionary Karl Marx (1818–83) later adapted Hegel’s scheme into his own theory (“historical materialism”), in which he claimed that economic progress, which caused conflict between the social classes, would inevitably one day result in the proletariat seizing power from the bourgeoisie, while the capitalist world order collapsed under its own inner contradictions. Arguably, Marxism was to prove the most influential and durable  of all historical “grand narratives.” 
Like other areas of knowledge, 
in the 19th century history under-went professionalization and it became an academic discipline. Academic history aspired to  the status of a science, and the accumulation of “facts” was its avowed purpose. A gap opened up between “serious” history—often heavy on economic statistics—  
and the colorful literary works of popular historians, such as Jules Michelet (1798–1874) and Thomas Macaulay (1800–59). 
The rise of social history
In the 20th century, the subject matter of history—which had always focused on kings, queens, prime ministers, presidents, and generals—increasingly expanded  to embrace the common people, whose role in historical events became accessible through more in-depth research. Some historians (initially those in France) chose to disregard the “history of events” altogether, preferring instead to study social structures and the patterns of everyday life, beliefs, and ways of thinking (“mentalités”) of ordinary people in different historical periods. 
A Eurocentric approach
Broadly speaking, until the second half of the 20th century, most world history was written as the story of the triumph of Western civilization. This approach was as implicit in Marxist versions of history as in those histories that celebrated the INTRODUCTION

It is widely believed that the 
origins of the human race lie in Africa. By the usual processes 
of biological evolution and natural selection, the genus Homo  evolved 
in East Africa over millions of years alongside the chimpanzees, its near relatives. By the same biological processes, Homo sapiens— modern 
humans—evolved alongside other hominins (the relatives of humans, including Neanderthals, who died out 40,000 years ago).
About 100,000 years ago or so, 
the scattered bands of hunting and foraging humans would have been almost indistinguishable from the other great apes. But at some point (precisely when is hard to define) humans began to change in a new way, not by the process of biological evolution but by cultural evolution. They developed the ability to alter their way of life through the creation of tools, languages, beliefs, social customs, and art. By the time they were painting exquisite pictures of animals on the walls of caves and carving or sculpting figurines out  of stone or bone, they had marked themselves out uniquely from other animals. Their transformation was slow in the early years, but it was set to gather incredible momentum over millennia. Humans had become the only animals with a history.
Discovering history 
The early development of human cultures and societies presents a particular problem to historians. The first writing was not invented until quite late in the human story—  
about 5,000 years ago. Traditionally, the period before writing tended to be dismissed as “pre-history,” since it left no documents for historians to study. However, in recent years  a wide range of new scientific methods—including the study of genetic material and radiocarbon dating of organic remains—have been added to the long-established techniques of archaeology, enabling scholars to shine at least a flickering light upon the pre-literate era. 
The narrative of the distant 
human past is under constant revision as new discoveries and research—its findings frequently disputed—create radical shifts in perspective. The fresh investigation of a single cave, a burial site, or a human skull can still throw large areas of accepted knowledge into question. However, in the 21st century much of the history of early humans can be described with a reasonable degree of confidence.INTRODUCTION

Nomadic hunter-gatherers
All historians agree that until about 12,000 years ago humans were hunter-gatherers, using stone tools and living in small, mobile groups. This period is referred to as the Paleolithic Era (or Old Stone Age). Humans were a successful species, expanding their numbers to perhaps 10 million and spreading to most parts of the Earth. Generally, they adapted well to the major natural climate changes that occurred over tens of thousands of years, although they were temporarily driven out of northerly areas, such as Britain and Scandinavia, during the coldest phase of what is popularly known as the Ice Age. 
Humans existed in an intimate 
relationship with their natural environment, but their effect on that environment even at this early stage was not necessarily benign. There is a disturbing coincidence between the spread of human hunters across the planet and the extinction of megafauna such as woolly mammoths and mastodons. Although human hunting is far from being identified as the sole cause of these extinctions—natural climate change may well have been a contributing factor—from our modern perspective they can seem to set a troubling precedent.
The farming revolution
The hunter-gatherer lifestyle, which can reasonably be described as “natural” to human beings, appears to have had much to recommend  it. Examination of human remains from early hunter-gatherer societies has suggested that our ancestors usually enjoyed abundant food, obtainable without excessive effort, and suffered very few diseases.  If this is true, it is not clear what then motivated so many human beings all over the world to settle  
in permanent villages and develop agriculture, growing crops and domesticating animals: cultivating fields was grindingly hard work, and it was in farming villages that epidemic diseases first took root. 
Whatever its immediate effect 
on the quality of life for humans, the development of settlements and agriculture indisputably led to a high increase in population density. Sometimes known as the Neolithic Revolution (or New Stone Age), this period was a major turning point in human development, opening the way to the growth of the first towns and cities, and eventually leading to settled “civilizations.”

years ago, although the earliest 
dates are controversial. Small groups may have visited much earlier, but the bulk of the evidence suggests widespread colonization of Australia only around 45,000 years ago, at much the same time as Homo sapiens  arrived in Europe.
Other hominin species
Homo sapiens  was the first hominin 
to arrive in Australia. However, in parts of Eurasia, humans did face competition. By the time humans reached Europe, Neanderthals  had already been there for around 250,000 years, having evolved  from an ancestor they shared  with modern humans, Homo heidelbergensis , and they were  
well adapted to life in the region. 
Further east, at Denisova Cave 
in Russia’s Altai Mountains, there is evidence of a mysterious species—the Denisovans—known only from their DNA. And on the island of Flores in Southeast Asia, fossils of another possible species—the short, small-brained Homo floresiensis —
date from just 18,000 years ago, although some researchers believe these were simply modern humans afflicted with some form of disease. 
Of all these species, Homo 
sapiens  is the only one to have 
survived and gone on to colonize the New World. Beringia, a land-bridge between Russia and Alaska, exposed when sea levels dropped as a result of the Ice Age, allowed humans to reach the Americas  from northeast Asia. The exact date remains controversial: stone tools from the c.13,000-year-old “Clovis culture” were once thought to have belonged to the earliest humans  in the New World. Older sites are now known, but many of the earlier dates, particularly in South America, remain highly contentious. 
The social network 
Until more evidence is found, the fates of the Denisovans and Homo floresiensis  remain unknown, while 
the most recent research suggests Neanderthals died out around 40,000 years ago. Many researchers believe the resourcefulness of Homo sapiens  
was crucial to its success in other species’ home territories in the face of climate change around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum. In particular, it is thought that they could also rely on more extensive social networks than those other species—an asset that would have proved crucial both to survival in lean times and to helping them colonize the unfamiliar environments they encountered as they expanded across the globe, perhaps following animal herds. 
■Homo sapiens : the only remaining hominin
There is no evidence of violence 
between humans and other species. Indeed, modern human DNA shows small traces of Neanderthal and Denisovan genes, suggesting that a few individuals from each species interbred, albeit rarely. 
Although Neanderthals were 
skilled manufacturers of stone tools and excellent hunters, modern humans may have been quicker to adapt, and therefore better able to cope with the rapid climatic changes occurring as the Ice Age progressed.  They developed new stone tools, as well as techniques  that made use of resources such as bone and antler. They also established extensive networks of support, enabling various groups to pool resources across large distances, enhancing  their chances of survival. This cultural adaptability may have been what allowed humans  to outcompete their cousins  for access to increasingly unpredictable resources. The human blitzkrieg across 
America testifies to the 
incomparable ingenuity and 
the unsurpassed adaptability 
of Homo sapiens .

dates are controversial. Small groups may have visited much earlier, but the bulk of the evidence suggests widespread colonization of Australia only around 45,000 years ago, at much the same time as Homo sapiens  arrived in Europe.
Other hominin species
Homo sapiens  was the first hominin 
to arrive in Australia. However, in parts of Eurasia, humans did face competition. By the time humans reached Europe, Neanderthals  had already been there for around 250,000 years, having evolved  from an ancestor they shared  with modern humans, Homo heidelbergensis , and they were  
well adapted to life in the region. 
Further east, at Denisova Cave 
in Russia’s Altai Mountains, there is evidence of a mysterious species—the Denisovans—known only from their DNA. And on the island of Flores in Southeast Asia, fossils of another possible species—the short, small-brained Homo floresiensis —
date from just 18,000 years ago, although some researchers believe these were simply modern humans afflicted with some form of disease. 
Of all these species, Homo 
sapiens  is the only one to have 
survived and gone on to colonize the New World. Beringia, a land-bridge between Russia and Alaska, exposed when sea levels dropped as a result of the Ice Age, allowed humans to reach the Americas  from northeast Asia. The exact date remains controversial: stone tools from the c.13,000-year-old “Clovis culture” were once thought to have belonged to the earliest humans  in the New World. Older sites are now known, but many of the earlier dates, particularly in South America, remain highly contentious. 
The social network 
Until more evidence is found, the fates of the Denisovans and Homo floresiensis  remain unknown, while 
the most recent research suggests Neanderthals died out around 40,000 years ago. Many researchers believe the resourcefulness of Homo sapiens  
was crucial to its success in other species’ home territories in the face of climate change around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum. In particular, it is thought that they could also rely on more extensive social networks than those other species—an asset that would have proved crucial both to survival in lean times and to helping them colonize the unfamiliar environments they encountered as they expanded across the globe, perhaps following animal herds. 
■Homo sapiens : the only remaining hominin
There is no evidence of violence 
between humans and other species. Indeed, modern human DNA shows small traces of Neanderthal and Denisovan genes, suggesting that a few individuals from each species interbred, albeit rarely. 
Although Neanderthals were 
skilled manufacturers of stone tools and excellent hunters, modern humans may have been quicker to adapt, and therefore better able to cope with the rapid climatic changes occurring as the Ice Age progressed.  They developed new stone tools, as well as techniques  that made use of resources such as bone and antler. They also established extensive networks of support, enabling various groups to pool resources across large distances, enhancing  their chances of survival. This cultural adaptability may have been what allowed humans  to outcompete their cousins  for access to increasingly unpredictable resources. The human blitzkrieg across 
America testifies to the 
incomparable ingenuity and 
the unsurpassed adaptability 
of Homo sapiens .

The Altamira cave complex, 
near Santander on the northern coast of Spain, 
comprises a series of passages  and chambers extending for nearly 984ft (300m) that boast some of  the best examples of Stone Age, or Paleolithic, cave art yet discovered. So impressive are the paintings that when the cave was discovered in 1880, they were widely considered fakes and took nearly 20 years to be accepted as the genuine creations of prehistoric hunter-gatherers. Some of the early artistic activity here may date from more than 35,000 years ago, although most of the famous paintings were probably created much later, around 22,000 years ago. These include the images in the famous Bison Chamber:  here the low ceiling is covered in representations of animals including multicolored, lifelike images of bison, expertly painted across the natural undulations of the rock in such a way as to make them appear almost three-dimensional.
The artistic impetus 
Other stunning displays of cave  art are also known, concentrated  in southwest France and northern Spain. They include not only  finely detailed images of animals, but also engraved and painted signs, symbols, and handprints. Archaeologists remain divided over the meaning and function of Stone Age art. One explanation is simply that these people appreciated the aesthetic qualities of art—just as their descendants do today. Others suggest that the incredible detail of some of the images—the sex of the animal or the season in which it was observed can still be determined, for example—may mean the paintings were a means of conveying vital survival information, such as which animals to hunt, and when and how they could be found and targeted. 
Hunting rituals
Alternatively, cave art might  be linked to the world views or religions of Paleolithic people.  Even today, many societies still living mainly by hunting and gathering share animistic beliefs, meaning they believe entities such as animals, plants, and parts of the landscape have spirits with which humans interact during their daily life. Many such societies’ religious specialists, or shamans, believe CAVE PAINTINGS AT ALTAMIRA

Creating images of animals  
may have also been part of “magic” rituals designed to improve the chances of success during hunting. For societies dependent on animal resources for a significant part of their diet, the importance of such rituals cannot be overstated. 
Initiation ceremonies
Other researchers have noted  that many of the handprints and footprints found beside the  art in the caves seem to belong  to quite young individuals.

share the same rare skeletal 
deformities and may therefore have been related. Although the reasons why these bodies were arranged this way will probably always be a mystery, it is clear that there was more to this burial than just the functional disposal of remains. 
At other sites, some individuals 
were buried with many “grave goods”—for example, the complex jewelry made from dentalium shells at Arene Candide, in Italy, and the striking spears fashioned from mammoth ivory at the burial site  
of two young children in Sunghir,  
in Russia. Some researchers have suggested that these richly adorned individuals—especially the young ones, who would not have had  
time in their short life to establish  
a reputation that might account  
for special treatment in death—imply that hierarchies and status distinctions were beginning to develop in some groups. However, they do not appear to have become widespread until much later. It is clear, however, that for the first  time, people were now increasingly concerned with what happened after death, and about how the dead should enter into the afterlife. 
Marking territory
Other researchers note that most “classic” Paleolithic cave art is concentrated in southwest France and northern Spain. This region would have been a relatively favorable place to live: even at the height of the Last Glacial Maximum, more southerly, warmer climates and hence more productive habitats attracted dense herds of animals. As a result, people may have lived here in fairly large numbers, packed closely together, leading to greater social tensions among groups vying for territory and resources. 
Just as human groups today— 
whether it be football supporters  or nation states—use symbols such as flags, costumes, and markings of CAVE PAINTINGS AT ALTAMIRA
borders, territories, and group identities, so European Paleolithic groups may have decorated caves for similar reasons at a time when there was the potential for intense competition for resources. 
Cooperation to survive
Such complex social interactions may help explain how Homo sapiens  
was able to survive in the harsh environments of Ice Age Europe. Hunter-gatherers probably lived in small groups scattered at relatively low densities across the landscape. Most archaeological sites from  
this time do not demonstrate any evidence of complex buildings or structures, suggesting that people moved around a lot, according  
to the weather and the local environment, often following large herds of animals like reindeer as they migrated with the seasons. 
Homo sapiens ’ ability to forge 
new relationships readily allowed groups of hunters to combine as and when necessary. When resources were plentiful, they would hunt together—for example, intercepting migrating herds of reindeer at places in the landscape where they were most vulnerable, such as in People thought of themselves

Historians are still unsure whether or not there are precise 
meanings behind the majority of cave art. Their best guesses are that they may relate to any one or more of several possibilities: art for art’s sake; spirituality; initiation rites; the marking of territory; and a method of imparting valuable information about hunting.

narrow valleys or at river crossings. 
In leaner times, these groups would split up again and range far across the landscape to find enough wild resources to sustain themselves. 
Early technologies
These hunter-gatherers expended considerable effort on hunting technology, since it could spell  the difference between life and death. They hafted elaborately worked stone tips on to spears that were then launched at the target using atlatls, or spear-throwers, designed to increase the distance over which a spear could travel  and the force with which it hit its target. These tools were crucial to hunting success, so it is no surprise that some of these atlatls were beautifully carved and decorated, often with representations of the animals being hunted. Similarly, they also painstakingly carved complex barbed harpoons from bone and antler for fishing. 
First seeds of a society
Delicately worked bone awls and needles suggest Stone Age humans also made warm clothes out of HUMAN ORIGINS
animal skin and fur with much more care than their predecessors, and they made many other items—from jewelry finely crafted from animal teeth and shell, to figurines carved from stone or sculpted from clay. Many of these may also have been traded, gifted, or exchanged with individuals from other groups as part of large-scale social networks. 
The unpredictable environments 
of Europe during the Last Glacial Maximum meant sharing resources with other groups in times of plenty could pay off significantly at a  
later date: if a group struggled to find resources in one area, others elsewhere who had previously benefited from their generosity would be more inclined to return the favor. These kinds of exchange relationships probably linked even very far-flung groups together into complex networks of individual  
and group relationships that were fundamental to survival in such  
a tough environment.

Rising temperatures
Temperatures eventually rose again, and today’s relatively warm and stable climate had become established by around 7000

The ice caps melted, and rising sea levels separated Eurasia from the Americas, turned Southeast Asia into an archipelago, and made islands out of peninsulas such as Japan and Britain, thereby isolating many human groups. The impact on ecosystems was particularly severe for the large animals known as megafauna—mammoths, for example. The open glacial steppe grasslands in which megafauna thrived were replaced by expanding forests, and across the globe the combination of environmental change and human hunting drove many species to extinction. The forests and wetlands of the new post-glacial world offered humans many new opportunities. They hunted large forest animals such as red deer and wild boar,  as well as smaller mammals like rabbits, and they foraged for a range of aquatic and coastal food sources. Migratory fish like salmon, sea mammals such as seals, and shellfish, seasonal wildfowl, and  a range of fruits, tubers, nuts,  and seeds all became important dietary staples. 
Changing lifestyles
In areas that were particularly  rich in natural resources, human groups may not have settled in  one place, sending small bands  on forays further afield to target specific resources. The Natufian communities of the Eastern Mediterranean, for example, were able to exploit abundant stands  of wild cereals in the Near East. Some groups began to manipulate their environments, burning vegetation and cutting down  trees to encourage their preferred plant and animal species to thrive. They started to select and care for productive plant species and sowed the seeds of favored strains, while managing and controlling certain animals. This manipulation led to these species becoming ever more reliant on human input—and to  the development of agriculture, a radical change in the human way  of life that has since resulted in even more dramatic human impact on the environment.

Ice cores and past environments
Paleoclimatologists study the 
elemental composition of the sediments laid down over time on ocean floors to understand how climates have changed in the past. Tiny sea creatures known as foraminifera absorb two different forms of oxygen, 
16O and 18O, from sea water. 
Because 16O is the lighter of the 
two, it evaporates into the air more easily, but during warmer periods it falls as rain and drains back to the sea. So 
16O and 18O 
exist in sea water and appear  in the shells of foraminifera, in roughly equal ratios. However, in cold conditions most of the evaporated 
16O does not return 
to the ocean but freezes as ice, so sea water contains more 
18O 
than 16O. When foraminifera die, 
their shells sink to the ocean floor, building up over time. Paleoclimatologists drill into  
the ocean floor to extract cores of sediment and study the changing proportions of 
16O and 
18O in different layers to see how 
climates have changed over time.Few humans have ever  
lived in a world of such 
extreme climatic and

Community cohesion
It is thought that the development of more formal religious organization and group ritual practices may have helped community cohesion. At many sites, buildings were set aside for such purposes; these were larger than domestic structures, with unusual features such as lime plaster benches and more evidence of symbolic and representational art: Çatalhöyük boasts murals and figurines of a range of subjects including wild animals such as bulls, leopards, and vultures. At many sites, some inhabitants remained in the community even when they died; they were buried under the floors of the houses. Sometimes they were later dug up and their skulls removed; facial features were molded on some in plaster and painted with ochre for display. At sites like Ain Ghazal in Jordan, large statues made of lime plaster have been found, and there are many examples of clay figurines of animals and (mainly female) humans. It is not clear whether these decorated skulls, statues,  
and figurines represent specific individuals or heads of households or lineages, or perhaps mythical ancestors or gods, but they may have been part of the communal ideologies, rituals, and social practices that helped smooth over tensions between individuals and broader regional groups, who were establishing more formal links with one another for long-distance trade and exchange of goods. Some of  
the success of Çatalhöyük may have been due to its role as a center for the large-scale trade of items made from the obsidian, or volcanic glass, of Hasan Dag ˇ. 
The many dramatic social and 
economic changes that came with the Neolithic revolution have helped shape both human history and the world’s ecosystems ever since.

Farming and health
The adoption of farming 
established a plentiful and stable long-term source of food, allowing for population growth. However, there were negative consequences, too. Farmers  
may have had to work harder  
at times than hunter-gatherers did, and their more limited  
diets—focused on just a few crops and animal species—led  
to nutritional deficiencies. 
The health of early farmers 
also suffered in other ways. Living at close quarters with animals meant that some animal diseases spread to humans—for example, smallpox, anthrax, tuberculosis, and the flu. Larger communities living at higher densities allowed for such diseases to be more easily passed around. It also caused problems in disposing of human and animal waste and thus a  
rise in intestinal complaints  
and waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid, while irrigation created breeding grounds for mosquitoes and parasites, infecting humans with diseases like malaria.

About 5,000 years ago, 
humans began to form societies of unprecedented 
complexity. These “civilizations” typically had state structures and social hierarchies, they built cities and monuments such as temples, palaces, and pyramids, and used some form of writing. The basis for the development of civilizations was progress in agriculture. When only part of the population was required to work in the fields to produce food, the rest could inhabit towns and palaces, performing a range of specialty functions as bureaucrats, traders, scribes, and priests. The invention of civilization undoubtedly raised human life to a new level in many ways—in technology, the arts, astronomy, the measurement of time, literature, and philosophy— but also established inequality and exploitation as the basis of society, leading to larger-scale warfare as states expanded into empires.
Emerging civilizations
The earliest civilizations developed  
in areas where it was possible  to practice intensive agriculture, usually involving use of irrigation systems—for instance, along the rivers of the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), the Nile in Egypt, the Indus in northern India and Pakistan, and the Yangtze and Yellow rivers in China. Although these civilizations of Eurasia and North Africa seem to have been founded independently of one another, they developed multiple contacts over time, sharing ideas, technology, and even diseases. All followed a pattern in which stone tools (the Stone Age) were replaced by bronze (the Bronze Age) and then predominantly iron (the Iron Age). In the Americas, where the Olmec and Maya developed the civilizations of Mesoamerica, the use of stone tools persisted and most of the epidemic diseases that plagued Eurasia were unknown. 
Writing and philosophy
From around 1000 bce, Eurasian 
civilizations found an innovative momentum. The use of writing evolved from practical record-keeping to the creation of sacred books and classic literary texts that embodied the founding myths and beliefs of different societies, from the Homeric tales in Greece to the Five Classics of Confucianism  in China and the Hindu Vedas in India.

Growing populations  
The ancient world reached the peak of its classical period around 2,000 years ago. The world’s population had grown from around 20 million at the time of the first civilizations to an estimated 200 million. About 50 million of these lived in a united Han China, while about the same number were under the governance of the Roman Empire, which had extended its rule to the shores of the Atlantic and the borders of Persia. In large part, the empires were successful because of efficient communications by land and water, and the ruthless deployment of military power. Long-distance trade routes linked Europe to India and China, and cities had expanded to  
a great degree—Rome’s population was estimated at over 1 million.
Civilizations in decline
The causes of the decline of these powerful classical empires from  the 3rd century 
ce have long been 
disputed among historians. Bred in overcrowded cities and transmitted along trade routes, epidemic diseases certainly played a part. Internal power struggles were also a major factor, leading to political fragmentation and a decline in the quality of government. But perhaps most crucial was the geographical limitation of the civilized areas of Eurasia. Both the Roman and Han empires built walls to mark and defend the borders of their empires, beyond which lived mostly nomadic or semi-nomadic “barbarian” tribes. The civilized societies had little or no military advantage over these peoples, who increasingly raided or settled within their territories. The eastern part of the Christianized Roman Empire survived until 1453, and Chinese civilization revived to full vigor under the Tang dynasty from 618, but Western Europe would take centuries to recover the levels of population and organization that it had known under the rule  of Rome.

For much of the 4th to the 2nd millennia 
bce, Mesopotamia was  
a mosaic of competing kingdoms and city-states such as Uruk, Isin, Lagash, Ur, Nippur, and Larsa. Hammurabi, the Amorite king of Babylon, unified the region through a combination of guile, diplomacy, opportunism, military might, and longevity. As was traditional with conquering kings, Hammurabi  used previous edicts as the basis  for his laws, but these laws were distinguished by the reach of his empire, and by the fact that they were inscribed on stelae (stone slabs), and so recorded in perpetuity. 
Hammurabi’s laws and their 
detailed prelude reveal much about life in what is known as the Old Babylonian Period. They contain judgments on matters ranging from property disputes and violence against the person, to runaway slaves and witchcraft.
Hammurabi’s legacy
Although Hammurabi’s laws seem to have carried little weight and were rarely followed at the time, and despite the fact that his empire disintegrated soon after his death, his reign was a turning point for southern Mesopotamia. He firmly established the ideal of a unified state, centered in Babylon, and his laws were copied by Mesopotamian scribes until at least the 6th century 
bce. They show many points of 
similarity with, and may have influenced, laws of the Hebrew Bible, which in turn influence laws in many societies today. 
■Hammurabi the  
Law-GiverIn around 2000 bce, the Amorites 
(Westerners), a semi-nomadic 
people from Syria, swept across Mesopotamia, replacing local rulers with Amorite sheikh dynasties in many of the city-states. By the early 18th century 
bce, the three most powerful 
Amorite kings were pre-eminent Shamshi-Adad in the north, Rim-Sin in Larsa in the south,  and Hammurabi in Babylon in the center. Over the course of his long reign, Hammurabi consolidated all of southern Mesopotamia into his kingdom and eventually extended his power as far up the Tigris as Nineveh, and as far up the Euphrates as Tuttul, on the junction with the river Balikh. He personally supervised the construction of many temples and other buildings.
The prelude to his code, a 
tribute to Hammurabi, and  
a long historical record of his conquests, boasts that his leadership was divinely sanctioned by the gods who passed control of humanity to Marduk (deity of Babylon), and so to its king. It also reveals he saw his role as the guarantor

 THE TEMPLES OF ABU SIMBEL ( c.1264 bce)
Around 1264 bce, the 
Egyptian pharaoh 
Ramesses II (c.1278–1237 
bce) had two mighty temples hewn 
out of the cliffs on the west bank  of the Nile in southern Egypt. The entrance was guarded by four vast statues of the pharaoh, seated in glory and wearing the symbols  of divine kingship, including the double crown that signified his authority over Upper and Lower Egypt. The temples were designed to signify and embody the unique status, ambition, and power of the ancient Egyptian pharaohs. 
The pharaonic tradition
Ramesses II inherited a tradition that was already very ancient: about 1,800 years earlier, King Narmer (called Menes by the ancient Greek historian Herodotus) first unified the kingdoms of the Upper (southern) and Lower (northern) Nile. Narmer’s deeds were recorded on a stone palette, which was recovered from a temple at Hierakonpolis in the 19th century and provides one of the earliest known depictions of an Egyptian king. The palette is inscribed with many of the symbols and traditions that would come to typify the pharaohs for the next three millennia. For instance, Narmer  is shown holding an enemy by  the hair, about to smite him, and Ramesses II was often depicted  in the same way—military might and supernatural strength were hallmarks of Egyptian kingship. The pharaoh, like the gods, was frequently shown much larger  than ordinary mortals.

 SIDDARTHA GAUTAMA  
 PREACHES BUDDHISM ( c.500 bce)
Siddartha Gautama, better 
known as the Buddha, was born at the end of the Vedic 
Age (1800–600 
bce) into a South 
Asia in transition. In the country’s caste system, the priestly Brahmins and the warrior-elite Kshatriyas ranked highest, and it was into  
this latter group that Siddartha Gautama was born.
India was then a ferment of sects 
and new ideologies, some of which espoused a philosophy renouncing the material world. Siddartha developed a similar philosophy based on mystical Hinduism, but  he also rejected the increasingly rigid strictures of Vedic ritual and the inherited piety of the Brahmins. Renouncing material possessions, he sought and eventually found enlightenment, and became the Buddha. He preached in northeast India and founded the Sangha—the monastic order of Buddhism—to continue his ministry. IN CONTEXT

 A CLUE TO THE  
EXISTENCE OF A SYSTEM  
OF PICTURE-WRITING  
IN THE GREEK LANDS
 THE PALACE AT KNOSSOS ( c.1700 bce)
In the 1890s, British historian 
Arthur Evans came across some ancient clay seals for sale 
in Athens. They originated from the relatively unexplored Mediterranean island of Crete, and for Evans they offered a tantalizing hint at the existence of the first writing system in Europe. 
Following the seals to their 
Cretan source, Evans decided to excavate a promising parcel of  
land at Knossos, in the north of the island, where he uncovered a vast palace complex. The iconography  
of the palace centered on a bull-cult, including frescoes that depicted the sport of bull-leaping. Evans named the civilization “Minoan” after the mythical Cretan King Minos, who—according to Greek legend—built a labyrinth to contain the Minotaur: a fearsome half-man, half-bull creature. In the process, Evans discovered that the Minoans had indeed invented an early type of alphabet, which he called Linear A.

in what is known as the Palatial Period of the Minoan civilization, palaces at Knossos, Phaistos, Malia, and Chania had been constructed in broadly similar forms, with the one at Knossos being the largest.  It was destroyed, possibly by fire or perhaps a tsunami, around 1700 
bce, 
but it was rebuilt soon after on the same site. At its peak, in about 1500 
bce, Knossos palace and the 
city that grew up around it covered 185 acres (75 hectares) and had a population of up to 12,000. 
The Minoan palaces all had large 
central courts, flanked by many-chambered buildings, and were highly decorated with frescoes of flora and fauna. In the extensive magazines (storehouses), the rulers—who may have served dual roles as priest-kings or priest-queens—  
gathered many commodities for redistribution. Minoan rulers also controlled trade with other Bronze Age civilizations around the Mediterranean, such as Byblos in Phoenicia (now Lebanon), Ugarit  
in Syria, pharaonic Egypt, and Mycenaean Greek settlements in the Cyclades and further afield. 
Linear A script
The Minoans developed their own script, probably initially for record-keeping and administration purposes. It began as hieroglyphic picture-writing, but later evolved into the Linear A syllabary, in which symbols denote syllables (rather than letters, as is the case with the alphabet). The Minoan language as recorded in Linear A script remains undeciphered to this day, but in around 1450 
bce the Minoans were 
invaded by the Mycenaeans from mainland Greece, who adapted the Minoan script into Linear B, which was used to write archaic Greek.
Not long after the Mycenaeans 
invaded Crete, Minoan civilization collapsed completely. However, the legacy of Minoan writing lives on through its connection with the Phoenician alphabet, which in turn would come to form the basis of the Latin alphabet that is used in many parts of the world today. 
■The Phaistos disc
Found in 1908 in the ruins of 
the Minoan palace at Phaistos, southern Crete, the Phaistos disc (shown above), made from fired clay and about 6in (15cm) across, is printed with symbols in an unknown script. Although dated to 1700 
bce, it 
was made using the technique of woodblock printing, which was not thought to have been invented for another 2,000 years or so (in China), making the disc one of the great archaeological mysteries. The symbols, many of which are recognizable as everyday objects, are arranged in a spiral and divided into words by vertical lines. Some scholars have drawn parallels between certain symbols in Cretan hieroglyphics and Linear A, suggesting that the writing on the disc may be an elaborated form of an existing Minoan script. There are many theories about the disc’s significance—  
some consider the inscription is a hymn to a goddess, others that it tells a story, or that the disc is a calendar or a game. Some experts even believe the disc to be a clever fake.

IN WAR IT IS THE FATHERS   
 WHO BURY THEIR SONS
 THE PERSIAN WARS ( 490–449 bce)
Leonidas of Sparta  
stood before his band  of 300 warriors facing the 
mightiest army the world had  ever seen. The envoy of his enemy demanded that he lay down his arms at the feet of the Persian  god-king. “Come and take them” was Leonidas’s laconic reply.
The Persian Wars (490–449 
bce), 
also known as the Greco–Persian Wars, pitted a vast and cosmopolitan empire against a small band of  city-states in the south of Greece.  
The conflict profoundly influenced the development of Classical Greek identity and culture, leaving a vivid trail in Western literature and myth. By contrast, the story of the Persian Achaemenid Empire remains comparatively neglected, belying the significance of that great Middle Eastern civilization. 
The Achaemenids
The first Persian Empire, ruled  by the dynasty known as the Achaemenids, grew rapidly. At its height it may have ruled over half the world’s population. It began in around 550 
bce, when the Persian 
king Cyrus the Great overthrew the ruling Medes, going on to conquer Babylonia, and Lydia (now in Turkey), which brought the Ionian Greeks under Persian rule. Cyrus’s successors Cambyses II and Darius extended the empire into Egypt and the Balkans, where Thrace and Macedon gave the Persians  a foothold in Europe.  
The Achaemenids established 
Persian rule as a model for later empires. Despite its vast size, the state embraced a degree of multi-culturalism, allowing conquered peoples to keep liberty of religion, language, and culture. There was investment in infrastructure—like A hoplite —or Greek citizen-solider—

network of roads to hold their empire together—and the military, and devolution of administration to local provinces. Under the Achaemenids, the Middle East was united under a single umbrella culture for the first time. 
Conflict with the independent 
Greeks arose after the city-states  of Athens and Eretrea supported  an unsuccessful revolt by the Ionians against Persian rule in  499 
bce. Darius responded by 
invading mainland Greece, but was defeated by the Athenians and their allies at Marathon in 490 
bce. 
He planned an even larger invasion, but it was only after his death that his son Xerxes began mustering a huge army to execute the plan. 
Father of Lies
The main source for the Greco–Persian Wars is the ancient  
Greek historian Herodotus of Halicarnassus, known as both  the Father of History and the Father of Lies. Herodotus estimated that Xerxes’ land army was made up  
Cyrus the Great The founder of the Achaemenid 
Empire was Cyrus II, later known as “the Great.” In around 557 
bce, 
he became king of Anshan,  
a vassal of the Median king.
According to legend, he won 
the Persian army’s support by making them spend one day clearing thorn bushes, and the next banqueting, then asking  
why they remained slaves to the Medes when, by backing his revolt, they could live in luxury.

The term “democracy” 
comes from the Greek words demos  (people) and 
kratos  (rule). The democracy that 
developed in ancient Athens around 507 
bce and flourished in  
its purest form from 462 to 322 bce, 
albeit with some interruptions, provided the model for what has become the dominant form of government in the world: by 2015, 125 of the world’s 195 countries were electoral democracies. The democracy of ancient Athens, however, differed from its modern form, reflecting the history of Athens and the warring Greek states of the age. 
Oligarchs and hoplites
After the chaos of the ancient Greek Dark Ages—a period that followed the breakdown of Mycenaean civilization around  1100 
bce and lasted until about  
the 9th century bce—most of the 
emergent city-states evolved into oligarchies, with powerful nobles monopolizing government and serving their own interests. In Athens, the Areopagus—a council and law court consisting of men of aristocratic birth—controlled the machinery of state, appointing officials and serving as a civil court, while the lower classes (thetes ) were excluded from office. 
However, the development of the 
“hoplite” model of citizen-soldiery in the 8th to 7th centuries 
bce proved 
disruptive to those who were in power, as it led to a certain level of egalitarianism. Hoplites were men in the heavy infantry, mainly free citizens, whose primary tactic was the phalanx—a military formation in which soldiers stood in tightly packed ranks, with each man’s shield protecting the hoplite to his left. Any man who could afford the arms and armor would be putting his life on the line to defend the state. As a result, a kind of middle class emerged, which declared that service should bring full citizenship and political representation. At the same time, the lower classes were also making demands, and tensions between them and the higher orders over key issues, such as land reform and debt slavery, threatened to lead to civil breakdown.
Solon and Cleisthenes
In Athens, some of these tensions were eased around 594 
bce by the 
reforms of the statesman Solon. He Pericles
Pericles (c.495–429 bce) became 
Athens’ most famous democrat 
and the leading man of the city-state for about 30 years.  
He came to prominence around  
462 
bce, when he helped the 
politician Ephialtes dismantle the Areopagus—the last bastion of oligarchic control. After Ephialtes’ death, Pericles undertook further reforms, including the introduction of pay for those serving in the courts, making it possible for even the poorest citizen to have his say. He is also believed to have helped drive Athens’ assertive foreign policy as the city sought to exploit its dominance of the Delian League. During the  
440s and 430s 
bce, Pericles  
was involved in an ambitious public building program that provoked controversy at home, where he fought off revolt, and abroad, where he was condemned for requisitioning money from the Delian League to pay for the Parthenon. Nonetheless, he was popular and was elected as general 
every year from 443

excluded. In the 4th century bce, 
out of the 300,000-strong total 
population of Attica—the region of Greece controlled by Athens—just 30,000 men comprised the voting population. In theory, men became voting citizens at age 18, but as they were generally liable for two years of military service they were not enrolled on the rosters of the council until they turned 20, and did not come into their full political rights until the age of 30.

A center of philosophy
As well as being the most powerful city-state in ancient Greece, Athens was also the crucible of  a revolutionary new direction in philosophy, in large part due to Socrates (c.469–399 
bce). Earlier 
Greek philosophers, collectively known as the pre-Socratics, had introduced a revolution of their own in human thought in the 5th and 6th centuries 
bce. They rejected

separation of powers. This was essential to make the practical operation of direct democracy possible. It also ensured that all citizens (men aged 20 and above) could serve and that power could not be abused.

Socrates turned his enquiries 
inward to more human matters— as Cicero said of him, “he brought philosophy down from heaven.” Socrates’ method was simply to ask questions—What is friendship? What is justice? What is knowledge? The Socratic method tended to lay bare the limits of existing thinking, often making people look foolish or pompous. Accordingly, Socrates was unpopular and eventually he was accused of two crimes by his enemies—corrupting youth by encouraging them to go against the government, and impiety, or lack of respect for the gods. Consequently, he was sentenced to death. 
Socrates’ successors
The fate of Socrates was taken as an indictment of democracy by his successors, particularly Plato (c.428–348 
bce), who saw him as  
a martyr for truth. Plato ran a school (the Academy) and developed  
ideas about universal truths and metaphysics that have shaped all subsequent religion and philosophy in the Western world. His student Aristotle (384–322 
bce) became 
equally influential, setting up the Lyceum school and writing on such diverse topics as politics, ethics, law, and natural sciences. 
Plato opposed democracy, as  
he believed that the people were not sufficiently equipped with philosophical grace to legislate and if governance were left in the hands of the ordinary, citizen tyranny would emerge. In his ideal republic, enlightened philosophers would rule as kings. He also challenged the basic principle of democracy—that of liberty ( eleutheria )—which 
he believed could divert people from the proper pursuit of ethics and cause social disunity.

THE CONQUESTS OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT  
(4TH CENTURY bce)
In one of the fastest and most 
daring military expansions in history, Alexander the Great, 
the young king of Macedon in the Balkans, blazed a trail of conquest across most of the known world of his day, and set in motion a process of Hellenization—the spread of Greek culture and its fusion with non-Greek, Eastern traditions—which endured for centuries. 
Alexander’s father, Philip II, had 
transformed this peripheral state into a formidable military power, and had waged campaigns against  his neighbors that culminated in Macedon’s domination over all of Greece. When he was assassinated in 336 
bce, Philip had been planning 
an expedition to West Asia, to free the former Greek city-states now ruled by the world’s superpower, the Persian Empire. After securing the Macedonian throne by destroying his rivals, Alexander set about pursuing his father’s quest, while satisfying his own thirst for glory. 
King of the world
After forcing the other Greek city-states to accept his authority, in 334 
bce Alexander marched into 
Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) at the head of an army of 43,000 foot soldiers and 5,500 cavalry. At its heart lay the Macedonian phalanx, a well-drilled, tight-knit corps of 15,000 men armed with the sarissa , 
a pike that was up to 23ft (7m)  long. When combined with the shocking cavalry charge provided by the king’s personal bodyguard, the Companions, the formation proved irresistible. 
After an initial victory over the 
Persians at the River Granicus in the northwest, Alexander pressed on across Asia Minor. He stopped at Gordium in the central kingdom of Phrygia, where tradition held that he who could untie a complex

was widely regarded as the most remarkable man who ever lived, and in terms of the breadth and duration of his renown, which

Born in 356

claimed descent from demigods and heroes, Alexander’s education under the philosopher Aristotle ensured he was steeped in Greek legend, and he came to believe he was invincible, even divine. As a general he was decisive, bold to the point of recklessness—with his own life and those of his men—and a brilliant tactician. He maintained the loyalty of his forces throughout his long and arduous campaign, but his quick and violent temper, fueled by his heavy drinking, occasionally spurred him to eliminate those closest to him, including his friends.

of diverse states, differing in culture, ethnicity, and language. During the era known to Chinese historians  as the Spring and Autumn Period (771–476 
bce), the region was 
nominally under the control of Zhou dynasty kings, but in reality their feudal system of government meant that only a token authority rested with the royal throne, while feudal lords held genuine power over what IN CONTEXT

gave way to the Warring States Period (476–221

power was consolidated into the hands of seven kingdoms: Qi, Chu, Yan, Han, Zhao, Wei, and Qin. At this point in China’s history it was by no means certain that an over-arching Chinese identity or state would emerge. If anything, it was more likely that the considerable geographical, climatic, cultural, and ethnic differences between  the various kingdoms would see the region develop in a similar fashion to Europe many centuries later, with multiple distinct and divergent national entities.

named Ying Zheng succeeded to the throne of Qin. He inherited a militarized state, in which effective bureaucracy, powerful armies, and competent generals combined to produce a formidable and ruthless war machine.

seven states were unified under his rule. Disdaining the old title of king (Wang), he styled himself as emperor (Huangdi). Since he was the first (Shi) emperor of the Qin dynasty,  he was known as Qin Shi Huangdi.
The governing philosophy of the 
Qin state had been legalism: strict centralization of power and severity in enforcing adherence to the law. The emperor now set about applying this philosophy throughout the whole of China, ruthlessly imposing cultural, linguistic, economic, and technological unity. All scripts except Xiaozhuan (small seal script) were banned. In addition, according to legend, the emperor gave orders for 400 Confucian scholars to be buried alive and all existing books to be burned; his reign was to mark a new “Year One” in the history and culture of China.

relocated to the emperor’s capital 
city Xianyang (near Xi’an, in the Shaanxi province), and their arms were confiscated, melted down, and then cast into giant statues. During the Warring States Period, the pressure of incessant military competition had generally favored the emergence of more meritocratic avenues for advancement, thereby facilitating social mobility while undermining the importance of noble lineage. In the Qin dynasty, aristocratic rule was replaced  with a centralized bureaucratic administration and the country was divided into 36 commanderies, which were administrative divisions controlled by appointed (not hereditary) governors. Censors, or inspectors, traveled the country to enforce adherence to Qin law. 
The Qin dynasty also saw the 
emergence of a new scheme of social stratification, with society divided into four classes: gentlemen (Shi), peasants ( Nong ), and two 
new classes that had emerged during the Zhou dynasty—artisans (Gong ) and merchants ( Shang ). The 
educated gentry would replace  the nobility as the main source of state officials. The merchant class was officially the lowest and most despised of the orders, and was subject to legal discrimination; however, wealthy merchants were able to use their financial muscle to become important political players. 
Great works
Among Qin Shi Huangdi’s greatest achievements were his ambitious civil engineering projects, although there was a great human cost as many lost their lives in the process. THE FIRST EMPEROR UNIFIES CHINA
Guarding the tomb of Emperor Qin 
Shi Huangdi, these life-sized terracotta soldiers were discovered in 1974 by workers digging a well. The figures were originally brightly painted and each has a unique facial expression.He is traditionally credited with 
building the first part of the Great Wall of China, to keep out nomadic tribes in the north, by connecting parts of old walls erected by the Warring States and then adding thousands of miles of new wall.Other projects included constructing the Lingqu canal, which linked the Xiang and Li rivers so military supplies could be transported from northern to southern China, and building military roads including “the Straight Road,” which was  497 miles (800 km) long and ran from Xianyang to the Great Wall. 
Most famous of all the emperor’s 
ventures was the construction of his own elaborate mausoleum complex, which took 38 years and over 700,000 workers to construct. It consisted of a giant pyramid covered in earth to create an immense mound, 328 ft (100 m) high and 1,640 ft (500 m) across. Within the pyramid was a tomb in which his beloved empire was recreated in miniature, complete with liquid mercury rivers and seas. Buried around the tomb were large pits filled with thousands of life-sized terracotta warriors, bureaucrats, and entertainers, all intended to serve the emperor in the afterlife. Workers on the tomb were killed after completing their tasks so the secrets of the mausoleum’s location and contents died with them, and the tomb remained undiscovered for over 2,000 years.

bringing the 500-year-old Roman Republic to an end in all but name.
Republican origins
From its ancient beginnings as a cluster of small villages on seven hills by the River Tiber, Rome grew into a city-state that was just one  of many on the Italian peninsula. According to legend, Rome was first ruled by kings, but in 509 
bce, 
the monarchy was overthrown and  it became a republic. A new constitution allowed the election of two top officials, known as consuls, to run the state, but in order to prevent abuse of power, their term was limited to one year. The office of king was also prohibited, and special provision was made for the appointment of a dictator to replace the consuls in times of crisis—his term being limited to six months.

through a combination of conquest and diplomacy until it incorporated the whole of Italy. Between 202 and 120 
bce, Rome came to dominate 
parts of North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, Greece, and what is  now southern France. Its conquered territories were organized into provinces, ruled by short-term governors who maintained order and oversaw the collection of taxes. 
By the 1st century 
bce, Rome 
was a Mediterranean superpower, yet its long tradition of collective government, in which no individual could gain too much control, was being challenged by the personal ambitions of a few immensely powerful military men. A series  of bloody civil wars, internal political struggles, and civil unrest culminated with the dictatorship  of Julius Caesar, a brilliant general and statesman, whose murder at the hands of his political enemies led to the demise of the republic and the birth of the Roman Empire.
The republic crumbles
In the period in which Julius Caesar came to prominence on  the Roman political scene (around 70 
bce), Rome was in turmoil: beset 
with ever worsening social and economic problems and torn by political conflict. Early in Rome’s history, the non-slave population had been officially split into two classes: the patricians (members  of the ancient hereditary nobility and wealthy landowners) and the  plebeians, or plebs for short (the common people). On the formation of the republic, only patricians  had been entitled to hold office in  the Senate—Rome’s governing and advisory council—but in 368–367 
bce, a constitutional amendment 
allowed the election of wealthier plebs too, and the result was a power-sharing arrangement.
However, in reality, a small 
group of patrician families known as the Optimates (the “Best Men”) had long dominated the Senate and jealously guarded their privileges. In the late Roman Republic, those who championed the rights of the plebs—the Populares (the “People’s Men”)—sought popular support against the Optimates, either in the interests of the people themselves, or more often, in pursuit of their own careers. The self-interested Optimates resisted making the social and economic reforms that were urgently required to meet the changing needs of the Roman people. In Italy and the provinces an unequal system of taxation and corrupt governance were causing social unrest, while in the city of Rome itself, the infrastructure was barely able to cope with a growing population. The empire’s rapid expansion had brought a flood of

through a combination of conquest 
and diplomacy until it incorporated the whole of Italy. Between 202 and 120 
bce, Rome came to dominate 
parts of North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, Greece, and what is  now southern France. Its conquered territories were organized into provinces, ruled by short-term governors who maintained order and oversaw the collection of taxes. 
By the 1st century 
bce, Rome 
was a Mediterranean superpower, yet its long tradition of collective government, in which no individual could gain too much control, was being challenged by the personal ambitions of a few immensely powerful military men. A series  of bloody civil wars, internal political struggles, and civil unrest culminated with the dictatorship  of Julius Caesar, a brilliant general and statesman, whose murder at the hands of his political enemies led to the demise of the republic and the birth of the Roman Empire.
The republic crumbles
In the period in which Julius Caesar came to prominence on  the Roman political scene (around 70 
bce), Rome was in turmoil: beset 
with ever worsening social and economic problems and torn by political conflict. Early in Rome’s history, the non-slave population had been officially split into two classes: the patricians (members  of the ancient hereditary nobility and wealthy landowners) and the  plebeians, or plebs for short (the common people). On the formation of the republic, only patricians  had been entitled to hold office in  the Senate—Rome’s governing and advisory council—but in 368–367 
bce, a constitutional amendment 
allowed the election of wealthier plebs too, and the result was a power-sharing arrangement.
However, in reality, a small 
group of patrician families known as the Optimates (the “Best Men”) had long dominated the Senate and jealously guarded their privileges. In the late Roman Republic, those who championed the rights of the plebs—the Populares (the “People’s Men”)—sought popular support against the Optimates, either in the interests of the people themselves, or more often, in pursuit of their own careers. The self-interested Optimates resisted making the social and economic reforms that were urgently required to meet the changing needs of the Roman people. In Italy and the provinces an unequal system of taxation and corrupt governance were causing social unrest, while in the city of Rome itself, the infrastructure was barely able to cope with a growing population. The empire’s rapid expansion had brought a flood of

slave labor from the provinces, 
driving many Roman farm workers and smallholders off the land and into the city in search of work. 
The rise of Julius Caesar
Meanwhile, a handful of military leaders in Rome’s provinces had begun to use their armies to jockey for political prominence. Among them was Julius Caesar, a highly intelligent and ambitious general from a patrician family who had aligned himself with the Populares and risen swiftly through the political ranks. Caesar was intent on making the reforms necessary  to meet the challenges of the republic, and so he maneuvered himself into a position that would allow him to achieve his goal.  
In 60 
bce, Caesar became 
consul, and two years later he was appointed governor of the province of Gaul, a role which enabled him  to remain abreast of developments in the Senate while also offering a springboard to military glory. In a series of masterful campaigns over the next eight years, he conquered Gaul, bringing the whole of what  is now France, along with parts of Germany and Belgium, under his rule. He also led two expeditions to Britain, in 55 and 54 
bce. Caesar’s 
heroic military exploits left him immensely rich and increased his personal prestige; he enjoyed the loyalty of his armies and the love  of the Roman mob, upon whom he could now afford to lavish feasts, games, and money.  
Buoyed by his achievements, 
Caesar attempted to dictate the terms on which he would return  to Roman politics, demanding to  be allowed to stand for a second consulship while remaining in command at Gaul. This put him  on a collision course with the Optimates in the Senate, since Roman law required military leaders to relinquish control of their armies before entering Rome, a prerequisite for running for office. Caesar knew that if he agreed to enter the city as a private citizen, without his armies, his political opponents would most likely attempt to try him for abuse of power during his first consulship. 
Back in Rome, the Optimates, 
alarmed by the implications of Caesar’s meteoric rise, allied themselves to one of his main political rivals, the renowned THE ASSASSINATION OF JULIUS CAESAR
general Pompey. The Senate passed laws intending to strip Caesar of his command when he returned from Gaul, and in 49 
bce they 
declared him hostis , or public 
enemy. In response to this direct threat, Caesar did the unthinkable: he marched his army on Rome.  En route, he paused at the border between the Gallic provinces  and Italy proper: a small river called the Rubicon. Caesar was acutely aware that crossing the river would constitute a declaration of war against the Senate but, quoting the Even yet we may draw back, 
but once across that little 
bridge, and the whole issue  
is with the sword. 
Julius Caesar 
Speaking to his army before  
crossing the Rubicon
Julius Caesar Gaius Julius Caesar was born in 
Rome in 100 bce, to a patrician 
family of distinguished ancestry. From an early age, he grasped that money was the key to power in a political system that had become hopelessly corrupt. He also quickly learned that forging a network of alliance and patronage would be crucial to his success. 
After serving in the war to 
crush the slave revolt led by Spartacus in 72 
bce, Caesar was 
briefly taken hostage by pirates. Once he returned to Rome in  
60 
bce, Caesar spent vast sums  
on buying influence and positions, eventually teaming up with the two other leading men in Rome, Crassus and Pompey, to form the so-called First Triumvirate. Between 58 and 50 
bce, he 
formed a provincial power base in Gaul where, without the sanction of the Senate, he launched a series of campaigns that made him master of Western Europe, with fabulous wealth and powerful armies. However, these campaigns also earned him many opponents among the governing classes, who would eventually cut short both his career and his life.

In the ensuing civil war, Caesar finally triumphed over Pompey’s forces at the Battle of Pharsalus  in northern Greece in 48 
bce.  
The defeated Pompey fled to Egypt for sanctuary, where he was later assassinated. After crushing the remaining pockets of resistance, Caesar finally returned to Rome in 45 
bce, to consolidate his political 
position. In 46 bce he accepted the 
dictatorship for 10 years; two years later, he was granted the office for life. Now in a position to begin the monumental task of reconstructing the Roman state and restoring stability to the empire, Caesar initiated far-reaching social and political reforms. He extended Roman citizenship; he enlarged  the Senate, bringing in allies from among the provincial aristocracy; he established colonies outside Italy, to help spread Roman culture and knit the empire together; he spent lavishly on grandiose public works and buildings; he cut taxes; and he even reformed the Roman calendar, introducing the system of leap years that is still in use today.
A murder plot
Caesar’s pragmatic solutions for re-establishing unity in the empire after years of chaos found favor with many parts of society, yet  at the same time, his increasingly autocratic attitude to power was alienating fellow members of the ruling class. They felt that Caesar was trying to destroy the cherished traditions of the Roman state, and to undermine the prestige of the nobility, and spread the rumor that he was planning to make himself king. Unfortunately, Caesar failed to  quell the suspicions. He accepted unprecedented honors, such as assuming the title “Imperator” (“Victorious General”) as a family name; he also allowed temples and statues to be erected in his honor, and had coins minted bearing his image. And when he adopted his grand-nephew, Octavian, there were fears that he was trying to establish a dynastic succession. Some members of the Senate concluded that the only solution  to the problem was to assassinate Caesar, and so they hatched a conspiracy to carry it out.ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS

He is also said to have recruited the most important conspirator, Marcus Junius Brutus, a trusted colleague and confidante of Caesar, opposed to the dictator’s presumed monarchic ambitions.

Death of a dictator
The assassination plot grew rapidly, 
eventually including 60 senators, among them many of Caesar’s close colleagues. The plotters decided  to strike at a meeting of the Senate that had been called for March 15, (the Ides of March). On the day, they gathered at Cassius’s home, each senator concealing a dagger beneath his robes, before moving on to Pompey’s Theatre—part of a great civic complex that Caesar’s old rival had constructed—where  the Senate was meeting. A group  of gladiators had been stationed in the theatre itself, to help control any crowd problems. However, many of the conspirators were nervous and ready to flee, convinced that the plot had been uncovered. 
Caesar had indeed been warned: 
a list of the plotters had been thrust into his hands, but he ignored it. His wife pleaded with him not to attend the Senate meeting, but one of the conspirators, stationed at Caesar’s house, helped calm her fears. When Caesar arrived at the meeting, a conspirator distracted his deputy, Mark Anthony, delaying him outside the theatre. As Caesar took his seat, the conspirators drew their daggers and struck, stabbing him 23 times. In an ironic twist, Caesar breathed his last slumped against the base of a statue of his old rival Pompey. 
The Second Triumvirate
Seized with manic fervor, the conspirators dipped their hands  in Caesar’s blood and rushed out into the Forum to proclaim their tyrannicide. In the power vacuum that followed, Mark Anthony, and Caesar’s heir, Octavian, promptly assumed control of the state, forming in 43 
bce a triumvirate (a group  
of three men holding power) with Lepidus, one of Caesar’s former allies. 
Needing to gather enough funds 
to stabilize their authority, and to remove political opposition, the triumvirate drew up a list of those who had supported Caesar’s murderers, and declared them outlaws. Around 200 senators and more than 2,000 equites (“knights” or minor nobility) were either killed or had their estates confiscated. The treasury’s coffers now filled, the triumvirate hunted down and destroyed Brutus and Cassius.In 40 
bce, the triumvirs met again, 
this time to carve up the Roman world. Africa was given to Lepidus, the East to Mark Anthony, and the West to Octavian. However, it was THE ASSASSINATION OF JULIUS CAESAR
not long before Octavian went to war against Anthony in north Africa, and, after defeating his forces at Actium in western Greece in 31 
bce, Octavian became the 
master of the Roman world. 
Rome’s first emperor
Octavian returned to Rome in  28 
bce and, instead of following 
Caesar’s example, he renounced the dictatorial powers granted  to him in order to wage his war against Antony. In 27 
bce, in 
gratitude for his service to Rome, the Senate bestowed on him  the name Augustus (“revered personage”) and granted him wide-ranging legal powers. Eventually, through political sleight of hand,  he became Rome’s sole ruler,  controlling all aspects of the Roman state and command of the army. 
An emperor in all but name  
(he was careful to spurn such titles, styling himself instead as princeps, or “first citizen”), over the next  four decades, Augustus set about transforming the ruins of the republican system into an imperial autocracy, all the while maintaining the illusion that his authority  was dependent on the will of the  people. He loosely established the boundaries of the empire, pushed through reforms to clean up both private and public life, and crushed dissent. After the long periods of exhausting civil war, many in the empire were grateful for peace. 
The Pax Romana
Indeed the might of the Roman military and the consequent improvements in security and stability across a vast stretch of territory, in what became known as the Pax Romana (“Roman Peace”), led to a growth in trade, economic activity, population, and general prosperity. The arts and culture Caesar, like a most  
gentle physician, had been 
assigned to the Romans  
by Heaven itself.

Provincials were even granted full Roman citizenship after a period of military service.
However, for the regions beyond 
the bounds of empire, Augustus’s Pax Romana often meant just the opposite. Even after reducing the army from 80 legions to a permanent force of just 28, Augustus had to find employment for 150,000 soldiers.  
He launched a series of campaigns to extend borders, suppress and harry rebels and “barbarians,” and seize slaves from conquered areas.

Augustus had established a new imperial system that would endure for centuries. For some years before his death, Augustus had prepared the way for an heir to succeed him, and retain control of the state. His step-son Tiberius was gradually ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS

a co-emperor. This smoothed the transition of authority on Augustus’ death, preventing a vacuum of power and ensuring continuity.

principle of direct succession and ensured the survival of the office of emperor. The system continued through multiple dynasties, with the empire reaching its height under the Nerva-Antonine dynasty when the emperor Hadrian ordered the building of a wall in northern Britain to mark the empire’s outer limit.

BY THIS SIGN CONQUER
 THE BATTLE OF MILVIAN BRIDGE (312 ce)
In October 312 ce, Emperor 
Constantine I was stationed  
at the Milvian Bridge near 
Rome, waiting to join battle with Maxentius, his rival for control of the Western Roman Empire (in 285, the empire had been split into two halves, eastern and western, each ruled by an emperor and a deputy).Tradition says that in the days before the encounter, Constantine had a vision of a flaming cross in the heavens bearing the inscription  
in hoc signo vinces (“by this sign conquer”). This convinced him that he had the support of the god of  the Christians, and this belief was upheld when his army went on to defeat Maxentius’s men. In fact,  the Christian god was not the first deity Constantine had auditioned; an earlier version of his vision had involved the Greek and Roman god Apollo. He appears to have been looking for theological “back-up” to legitimize his ambition to become sole emperor, and a monotheistic supreme being may have seemed  to him a good fit: a heavenly mirror image of his own position on Earth. 
Constantine I’s adoption of 
Christianity after his victory at the Milvian Bridge gave the faith a huge boost: it rapidly gained more followers and began edging out the pagan cults.IN CONTEXT

Despite the legend of his divine 
vision, Constantine’s conversion  to Christianity seems to have been gradual rather than immediate—he was not baptized until many years later, on his deathbed. However, soon after his victory at the Milvian Bridge, he began the process of rehabilitating, and then exalting, Christianity; in 331 
ce, he issued 
the Edict of Milan, a proclamation that established religious toleration for Christianity within the empire. 
A multi-faith empire
For almost 300 years after the life  of Jesus Christ, the religion based on his teachings remained a minor sect within the Roman Empire, practiced alongside many other faiths, both mono- and polytheistic. Some aspects of Christianity,  such as its egalitarian nature,  made it suspicious to the imperial authorities however, and Christians were periodically persecuted. 
All across the ancient world at 
this time, changing social, political, and economic conditions were reflected in cultural and religious changes; Christianity was just  one of a number of monotheisms gaining popularity in the Roman Empire, including the Persian cult of Mithraism, with which it had much in common. 
The rise of Christianity
In 324, after disposing of the emperor in the East, Constantine became sole ruler of the Roman Empire, and then sought to use Christianity as a unifying force across his diverse and fractious realm. To make the increasingly dominant eastern half easier to govern, he founded a new city called Constantinople (now Istanbul), consecrating it with both Christian and pagan rites, but allowing only Christian churches to be built. Although it would take time for  all Roman citizens to convert to Christianity, in Constantine’s reign, the higher ranks of society, seeking political advancement and personal favor with the emperor, flocked to the Church, and the emperor built basilicas across the empire. 
Christianity, however, was not a 
single, uniform religion at this time, and splits, or schisms, formed.  In 325, Constantine convened  the Council of Nicaea—the first universal council of the Christian Church—mainly to settle the Arian schism, a theological dispute over whether Jesus was of the same substance as God. 
Rome is Christianized
In the mid-300s, Emperor Julian, an adherent of the old religion, tried  to revive paganism, but it was too late: Christians had become a majority, at least in the East. The faith was increasingly bound up with empire, as the Roman state adopted and molded the Church into an instrument of social and political control, unity, and stability.
Under Emperor Theodosius I 
(reigned 379–395), pagan temples and cults were suppressed, heresy was outlawed, and Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire. Eventually, it also became the faith of the barbarian successor states in the Roman Western Empire, as well as of the Byzantine Empire in the East. Over the course of many centuries, the western (Catholic) and eastern (Orthodox) churches grew apart  in doctrine and organization, but Christianity endured.

single, uniform religion at this time, and splits, or schisms, formed.  In 325, Constantine convened  the Council of Nicaea—the first universal council of the Christian Church—mainly to settle the Arian schism, a theological dispute over whether Jesus was of the same substance as God. 
Rome is Christianized
In the mid-300s, Emperor Julian, an adherent of the old religion, tried  to revive paganism, but it was too late: Christians had become a majority, at least in the East. The faith was increasingly bound up with empire, as the Roman state adopted and molded the Church into an instrument of social and political control, unity, and stability.
Under Emperor Theodosius I 
(reigned 379–395), pagan temples and cults were suppressed, heresy was outlawed, and Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire. Eventually, it also became the faith of the barbarian successor states in the Roman Western Empire, as well as of the Byzantine Empire in the East. Over the course of many centuries, the western (Catholic) and eastern (Orthodox) churches grew apart  in doctrine and organization, but Christianity endured.

 THE SACK OF ROME (410 ce)
In 410 ce, Rome fell to an army of 
nomadic Germanic peoples—
Visigoths—who pillaged the 
city over the course of three days. Although Rome had already ceased to be the capital of the Western Roman Empire and the destruction was relatively restrained, the sack sent shock waves across the world. Changes known as the Migration Period, or the Barbarian Invasions, were then taking place, with great movements of peoples across all of Eurasia, from China to Britain. Barbarian peoples began to invade settled empires such as those of Rome and China from around 300 to 650. They carved out new IN CONTEXT

Climatic changes in Central Asia drove the nomadic horse tribes of the steppes to seek better pastures, which in turn forced neighboring nomads to invade the so-called civilized empires. China was ravaged by the Xiongnu, Persia by the Hepthalites, and India by the White Huns.
Barbarians at the gates
In Europe, the arrival of the Huns  in the lands east of the Rhine and north of the Danube displaced Germanic tribes who had long lived in delicate balance with the Roman Empire. The Visigoths moved into Roman lands, eventually storming Rome in 410, while other tribes including the Vandals, Suevi, Alans, Franks, Burgundians, and Alemanni invaded and settled territory from Gaul to Spain to North Africa.  
In the 440s the Huns, under Attila, ravaged Eastern Europe before being defeated by a coalition of Romans and Germans. The Western Roman Empire shrank to encompass little more than Italy itself, its puppet emperors controlled by barbarian generals. In 476, the last nominal emperor was deposed by one such general, Odoacer, marking the end of the Roman Empire in the west.The Western Empire had however been in decline since at least the 3rd century. Its population and economy had diminished, making it increasingly financially dependent on the Eastern Empire; weakening central authority had given more autonomy to the provinces. The military, obliged to recruit from barbarian tribes, was losing its core strength. In reality, the Barbarian Invasions were probably part of a process: a transition, rather than  
a fall. Roman customs, culture, language, and particularly its religion in the form of Christianity, endured across the provinces, and many of the new ruling elite saw themselves as continuing in the tradition of Rome. The city itself survived sack by Alaric and his Visigoths, and by the Vandals in 455, and flourished under Theodoric the Ostrogoth (489–526). 
In their turn, the successor 
states formed by Germanic tribes over the following centuries eventually found themselves under attack by further waves of invaders such as the Magyars and Vikings. 
■The barbarian “other”
Barbarian was a Greek word 
signifying the unintelligible babble of those who did not speak Greek, and therefore could not be considered civilized. Romans adopted this “them-and-us” construction. However, by the 4th century, the boundaries between Rome and its barbarian neighbors were blurred, both culturally and geopolitically: the barbarians had become more like the Romans, and vice versa. The Roman army comprised mostly barbarians—either Germanic auxiliaries and mercenaries,  or Roman citizens who were actually Gauls, Britons, or one  
of the hundreds of other groups and ethnicities. Nevertheless, much Roman culture survived the invasions. For instance, although much of Italy, Gaul,  and Spain fell under the sway  
of the “Germanic” Goths,  
Suevi, and Vandals, their languages resisted Germanic influence and remain Romance languages—that is, languages that have evolved from the Latin spoken by Romans in Rome.

THE INDUS VALLEY 
CIVILIZATION COLLAPSES
c.1900–1700 bce 
The Indus Valley Civilization  
(c.3300–c.1700 bce) was based 
around large cities with planned streets and impressive drainage and water-supply systems in what are now Pakistan and northwestern India. By 1900 
bce, this civilization 
was in decline and no longer producing the elaborate jewelry and fine seals for which it was famous. By c.1700 
bce, the great Indus cities 
of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro were virtually empty. The reason is unclear, but the most likely explanation is a combination of crop failure and a decline in trade with Egypt and Mesopotamia. There is also some evidence of flooding due to a change in the course of the Indus River. 
EMPEROR WU CLAIMS THE 
MANDATE OF HEAVEN
(1046 bce)
The idea that the emperor of China 
rules with the approval of heaven dates to the Zhou dynasty, which was founded when Wu and his ally Jiang Ziya defeated the long-ruling Shang at the Battle of Muye in 1046 
bce. The Shang had presided  
over a long period of peace and prosperity but by the 1040s had become corrupt. The Zhou concept of the Mandate of Heaven aimed  to prevent this from happening, placing good government above noble birth, and sanctioning others tools and ornamental objects in bronze, but they were also among the first in Europe to use iron for items such as swords. Their striking bronze jewelry bore intricate patterns featuring spirals, knotwork, and animal designs, which had a lasting influence on later Celtic art.
THE PELOPONNESIAN 
WARS
(431–404 bce)
The Peloponnesian Wars were 
fought between Athens (initially the most powerful Greek city- state and the center of classical civilization) and the more militaristic Sparta. Sparta first launched land-based attacks on Athens, while Athens used its superior sea power to suppress revolts along the coast. In 413 
bce, 
an attack on Syracuse, Sicily,  went wrong, leaving most of the Athenian force destroyed. Then  the Spartans, allied with Persia, supported rebellions in a number  of Athenian subject states and finally wiped out the Athenian fleet at Aegospotam (405 
bce). The war 
deeply damaged Athens, ending the golden age of Greek culture  and leaving Sparta dominant.
HANNIBAL INVADES ITALY
(218 bce)
By the 3rd century bce, Carthage,  
in Tunisia, had established  
itself as a major regional power, extending along the coast of North Africa before invading Spain in  FURTHER EVENTS
to overthrow the ruler if he did not display these qualities. It influenced the way the Chinese regarded their rulers for thousands of years.
JUDAH DEFIES THE 
ASSYRIANS
(c.700 bce)
In the 9th century bce, the Hebrew 
state of Judah (west of the Dead 
Sea) was part of the large Assyrian empire. In the 8th century, the Judaean ruler Hezekiah refused  to pay tribute to the Assyrians.  The Assyrian king, Sennacherib, laid siege to Jerusalem (an event described in the Bible), but the Judaeans resisted their mighty enemies, who failed to take the city. Although this was a relatively small setback for Assyria, it was a triumph for the Judaeans, who attributed their victory to Yahweh. This was a major factor in the Hebrew peoples’ adoption of monotheistic religion soon after.
CELTIC CULTURE 
FLOURISHES AT HALLSTATT
(c.650 bce)
In the 8th century bce, a distinctive 
culture developed around Hallstatt, 
southeast of modern Salzburg, in Austria. Hallstatt’s people were Celts, probably originally from Russia, and by the time their civilization reached its highest point, around 650 
bce, it had spread  
west to eastern France, east into Romania, and north to Bohemia and Slovakia. Its people produced fine

the 230s bce. In 218 bce, Hannibal, 
Carthage’s commander in Spain, took his army across the Alps to attack Italy. Despite a series of victories in what became known  as the Second Punic War, Hannibal could not take Rome itself and in 202 
bce, he returned to Africa.  
The Romans had proved their strength, put an end to the idea that Carthage was invincible in  the Mediterranean, and paved the  way for their own rise to power.
VERCINGETORIX IS 
DEFEATED AT ALESIA
(52 bce)
In 52 bce, the Gaulish chieftain 
Vercingetorix led a revolt of local 
tribes against the Roman conquest of Gaul (modern France). At the Battle of Alesia, in Burgundy (eastern France), Roman forces under Julius Caesar built an ingenious donut-shaped fortification around the town, blocking Vercingetorix inside  while also creating a stronghold against Gaulish reinforcements. The chieftain was forced to surrender, and after five years in captivity he was strangled on Caesar’s orders. The battle resulted in an all-embracing Roman Empire stretching right across Europe.
ROMANS OCCUPY BRITAIN
(43 ce)
In 43 ce, on the command of the 
emperor Claudius, a Roman invasion force landed in Britain.  In spite of opposition from local chieftains such as Caratacus, and  a later revolt by the Iceni tribe under their leader Boudica, Roman rule eventually extended across England to the Scottish border and into Wales. The Romans governed Britain until c.410, founding towns, developing a system of roads, and introducing such innovations as underfloor heating and the use of concrete for building. Many Britons benefited from Roman rule and from strong trading links with  the empire in products such as metals and grain. 
CHINA IS DIVIDED INTO  
THREE KINGDOMS 
(220 ce)
The last years of the Han dynasty in China were marked by bitter divisions and fighting that led in 220 
ce to the country being divided 
between three rival emperors,  
all claiming to be the rightful successors of the Han. These  
Three Kingdoms—the Wei in the north, the Wu in the south, and the Shu in the west—reached a fairly stable agreement over territory until fighting broke out from  
263, when the rival Jin dynasty challenged and then conquered them. The wars had a devastating impact on the population.
THE MAYA CLASSICAL

across Mexico and Guatemala  that featured distinctive temples shaped as stepped pyramids, carved monuments inscribed  
with dates from the complex  
Maya calendar, and a large and extensive trade network. The largest city was Teotihaucan in central Mexico, although lowland cities such as Tikal were also powerful. Maya civilization left a lasting mark in North and Central America, its culture influencing later peoples, such as the Aztecs.
OBELISKS ARE ERECTED  
IN THE KINGDOM OF AXUM
(4th century ce)
In the 4th century ce, the people of 
the Ethiopian city of Axum erected tall stone obelisks that would be a feature of their civilization. Axum dominated the maritime trade routes around the Horn of Arabia and into the Indian Ocean, offering traders a vital link between Asia and the Mediterranean making the kingdom an impressive income. The obelisks are up to 108 ft (33 m) tall and are thought to be memorials  
to prominent people. They testify  to the power of this early African kingdom and its development  of a distinctive civilization. The obelisks have become symbols  of enduring African culture.
CLOVIS UNITES GAUL
(late 5th century ce)
The end of Roman rule in Gaul (modern France) came about  when Clovis, leader of the Salian Franks, defeated the Roman leader Syagrius in 486 
ce. This victory, 
which added to those of Clovis’ father Childeric, brought virtually all of France north of the Loire under the rule of his dynasty,  called the Merovingians, after  his grandfather Merovech. The Merovingians ruled France for some 300 years, making real  the idea of a united France independent of outside rulers.

Historians call the period 
from 500 to 1500 “the Middle Ages,” seeing it as  
a separate era sandwiched between the ancient world and modern times. In reality, there was never a clear break with the ancient world. In the eastern Mediterranean, the Roman Empire continued for almost 1,000 years after the fall of Rome, although it was rebranded by historians as  the Byzantine Empire. The ancient tradition of a united China ruled by an emperor was revived in the 6th century and continued to the Ming dynasty, albeit with interruptions. Even in Western Europe, where the breakdown after the Roman Empire’s collapse was most evident, Christian religion survived in Rome as the key marker for the distinction between what were considered “civilized” and “barbarian” societies.The rise of Islam
The dominance of two mutually hostile monotheistic religions—Christianity and Islam—was the most distinctive characteristic of this period across much of Eurasia. The founding of Islam in the 7th century was a transformative event, and Arab armies inspired by the faith altered the political landscape: Muslim rule spread from Spain in the west to central Asia in the east.
Although a united Islamic 
caliphate could not be sustained, the religion ensured a continuity  of civilization even when power shifted from the Arabs to other peoples such as the Turks. The great cities of the Muslim world surpassed any in Christendom in size and sophistication, and Muslim scholars preserved the science of the ancient Greeks and built upon it. Islamic civilization remained dynamic and expansive throughout the entire medieval period. 
Western European fortunes
In Western Europe, civilization fell drastically from the level achieved under the Roman Empire. Warrior kings ruled over a thinly spread population sustained by subsistence agriculture, and the area remained prey to non-Christian raiders and invaders, such as the Vikings and the Magyars, into the 10th century. 
A nostalgia for ancient Rome  
led to King Charlemagne being crowned emperor in 800, but the Holy Roman Empire, based on  the tradition Charlemagne founded, failed to unify Western Europe politically. In the absence of strong centralized state systems, feudal relationships held societies together. INTRODUCTION

From the 11th century, a revival of Western European culture, trade, and urban life gathered pace. The “Medieval Warm Period” (950–1250), when Europe experienced above-average temperatures, improved yields from agriculture; it was also a time when great cathedrals and castles were constructed. But  even when the Christian crusaders fought their way to Jerusalem at the heart of the Muslim world, the flow of civilization was the other way, with Islamic scholars far advanced in medicine, philosophy, astronomy, and geography.
Expansion and contraction
By the 13th century, the world’s population is believed to have risen to around 400 million—double its total at the high point of the ancient empires. A wide-ranging network linked Europe to China and the thriving trading kingdoms of Asia, by land along the Silk Road and by sea across the Indian Ocean. Cairo and Venice both became wealthy cities as focal points at the western end of this trade. 
However, civilized life remained 
precarious. The Mongols—nomadic warriors from the Asian steppes—seized major cities from the Middle East to southern China, carrying out large-scale massacres. Lethal diseases were also highly prevalent. Carried along the trade routes in the mid-14th century, the Black Death epidemic may have killed a quarter of the world’s population.
Inventions and progress
Technological progress was slow but cumulatively substantial. As the world’s most advanced country, China was the ultimate source of most inventions, from paper and printing to the magnetic compass and gunpowder. Even relatively backward Europe benefited from improvements in shipbuilding and metalworking, and the invention and spread of the plow and the windmill transformed agriculture. 
By the end of the Middle Ages, 
Western European kingdoms had developed from “feudal” states, based on oaths of loyalty, to more stable and centralized states, able to channel their key resources into the large projects of colonization and exploration. In the Americas, meanwhile, civilizations such as the Aztecs and Incas continued to evolve independently, untouched by developments in Eurasia and Africa, until the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the 16th century.

By the 13th century, the world’s population is believed to have risen to around 400 million—double its total at the high point of the ancient empires. A wide-ranging network linked Europe to China and the thriving trading kingdoms of Asia, by land along the Silk Road and by sea across the Indian Ocean. Cairo and Venice both became wealthy cities as focal points at the western end of this trade. 
However, civilized life remained 
precarious. The Mongols—nomadic warriors from the Asian steppes—seized major cities from the Middle East to southern China, carrying out large-scale massacres. Lethal diseases were also highly prevalent. Carried along the trade routes in the mid-14th century, the Black Death epidemic may have killed a quarter of the world’s population.
Inventions and progress
Technological progress was slow but cumulatively substantial. As the world’s most advanced country, China was the ultimate source of most inventions, from paper and printing to the magnetic compass and gunpowder. Even relatively backward Europe benefited from improvements in shipbuilding and metalworking, and the invention and spread of the plow and the windmill transformed agriculture. 
By the end of the Middle Ages, 
Western European kingdoms had developed from “feudal” states, based on oaths of loyalty, to more stable and centralized states, able to channel their key resources into the large projects of colonization and exploration. In the Americas, meanwhile, civilizations such as the Aztecs and Incas continued to evolve independently, untouched by developments in Eurasia and Africa, until the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the 16th century.

 BELISARIUS RETAKES ROME (536 ce)
On December 9, 536 ce, the 
army of the Eastern Roman 
(or Byzantine) Empire, led 
by general Belisarius, entered the city of Rome through the ancient Porta Asinaria gate. The Byzantine’s arrival forced the rapid departure of the city’s current defenders, the barbarian Ostrogoths, who were fleeing northward through the  Porta Flaminia. Almost precisely  60 years after Italy had fallen out of imperial hands, it appeared that the empire’s ancient birthplace might be restored to Roman rule.
The survival of Byzantium
While the Western Roman Empire finally fell in 476 after a century of barbarian invasions, the eastern portion—the Byzantine Empire, with its capital at Constantinople (modern Istanbul)—weathered the storm, its retention of rich provinces, such as Egypt, enabling it to mount a successful defense of its territory. However, the loss of the empire’s birthplace was a blow to the prestige of the Byzantine emperors, who refused to accept it. In 488, the Emperor Zeno despatched one  tribe of Germanic barbarian mercenaries, the Ostrogoths, to remove another, led by Odoacer, IN CONTEXT

The Gothic War
For the following 40 years, the Goths’ rule of Italy was relatively untroubled. However, the accession of Justinian (c.482–565) as Byzantine emperor in 527 changed things.

Around 610 ce, in a cave in  
the hills above the town  
of Mecca, central Arabia, 
Muhammad—a 40-year-old man from a merchant family—declared that he had received a divine message from the angel Gabriel. This was followed by similar revelations over the coming months and years and led to the founding of a new monotheistic religion: Islam. Within 20 years, this creed had come to dominate the Arabian peninsula, and a century later its followers had shattered the ancient Byzantine and Persian Empires, creating a state that stretched from Spain in the far west to Central Asia in the east.

Arabia before Islam
From the first millennium bce there 
were sophisticated kingdoms in 
southern Arabia, which derived their wealth from the spice trade.  In the early days, the trade routes ran along the northwest coast,  
but by the 7th century these  had diminished as merchants increasingly used a maritime  route up the Red Sea, leaving many places that had been relatively prosperous in decline. There were  a few scattered towns, such as Medina (then known as Yathrib) and Mecca, which were dependent on more local trade in wool and leather, along with a few key imports such as grain and olive oil. The central desert regions of the Arabian peninsula were very poor: Bedouin tribes followed a nomadic lifestyle, and competition for scarce resources shaped a society in which primary loyalty was to  a kinship group, or tribe. 
At the time of Muhammad, 
Arabia was in a state of religious and political ferment. Strong Jewish communities had become established in Yemen in the south and in northwestern oasis towns, such as Medina, while Christianity had gained footholds in Yemen and eastern Arabia. Although monotheistic faiths were making inroads against the traditional polytheistic paganism of the Bedouin Arabs, paganism still remained strong. Conflict between tribes was also common, and in Mecca, in the sacred enclosure known as the haram , a truce was 
enforced so men of different tribes could trade freely without violence.

Muhammad 
The Prophet Muhammad was 
born in Mecca around 570 ce  
to a branch of the influential Quraysh tribe. Tradition relates that he was an orphan, whose first marriage to a wealthy widow named Khadijah secured his economic future. The religious revelations that were imparted to Muhammad over  
a period of about 12 years from about 610—and which would later be written down as the Qur’an—caused a rupture with the traditional Meccan elites when he began to preach against pagan polytheism  
and practices such as female infanticide. Muhammad’s flight to Medina in 622 marked a key moment in the spread of Islam, as its acceptance outside Mecca showed that its appeal might transcend traditional kinship structures. Muhammad proved an inspirational leader, and his adept handling of the challenges facing the new religion meant that by the time of his death in 632, two years after his return to Mecca, its adherents had spread throughout Arabia.there was but a single God, and 
that believers needed to follow  a prescribed set of religious observances—including praying five times a day and fasting during Ramadan—set his followers apart. His preaching of a single religious community that cut across social boundaries was perceived as threatening by the traditional leaders, who felt it undermined  the source of their authority. 
The flight to Medina
By 622, the atmosphere in Mecca had become so tense that Muhammad and his handful of followers fled north to Medina— an event called the hijra  (meaning 
emigration), which marked the real foundation of the Islamic community. The Medinans, who resented the power of the Mecca-based Qurayshi, were sympathetic to Muhammad’s cause and allowed him to preach freely, giving him the opportunity to attract further converts.

years violence had broken out 
between the established powers there and Muhammad’s supporters. Muhammad outmaneuvered the Qurayshi, first by raiding their caravans, then defeating them in  a pitched battle in 627, and finally negotiating the right to return to Mecca on a pilgrimage in 629. By the time he died in 632, Muhammad was re-established in Mecca, and his diplomatic and military successes in attracting other tribes to his cause had made his position unassailable. As his authority spread, so too did the reach of his religious message and the numbers of new Muslim converts. MUHAMMAD RECEIVES THE DIVINE REVELATION
The Battle of Uhud (in 625) was one 
of several bloody conflicts fought between the Muslims of Medina,  led by Muhammad, and the larger Qurayshi army from Mecca. 
Conquests beyond Arabia
Having secured their position, 
Muhammad’s successors, in particular Umar (634–44), initiated campaigns of conquest further afield. They were fortunate in that profound changes had occurred  on the northern fringes of Arabia. Between 602 and 628, the two long-established empires in the area— the Byzantines to the northwest and the Persian Sassanids to the northeast—had been engaged  in a long, vicious war that ended in catastrophe for both parties. Their coffers had been drained by the costs of the conflict and some regions within their territories had been utterly devastated. Both sides had also become reliant on Arabs to defend their borders and small, semi-independent Arab states had emerged on the peripheries of the two empires.
Rapid defeat
The Arab armies that swept northward in the 630s faced far less resistance than they would have half a century earlier. Provinces fell easily as weakened garrisons and the doubtful loyalty of citizens undermined resistance. Although relatively small in number and lightly armed, the Arab armies were very mobile and did not need to defend fixed positions, giving them a huge advantage over their opponents. When they defeated the Byzantines at Yarmuk in 636, the whole edifice of imperial control in Palestine and Syria came crashing down. In the case of Persia, it took Arab generals just nine years to dismember the Sassanid Empire. After Muhammad’s death, Islam entered a crisis and the fledgling religion might easily have been crushed. Tribes in the east broke away from the Muslim religious community (the umma ) and 
declared allegiance to their own prophet, while the Medinans were unhappy about the dominance of Meccans in the movement. The choice of Abu Bakr, Muhammad’s father-in-law, as caliph (successor) signaled that the leadership would remain in the Prophet’s family and this, together with a series of successful military campaigns against the malcontents, enabled the umma  to survive.

Islamic society
The newly conquered lands became part of an Islamic caliphate. Many  
of its inhabitants converted, while those who did not were tolerated  if they were Christians, Jews, or Zoroastrians, provided they paid a special tax. Islam transformed the lands it absorbed in many ways.  As well as sweeping away the old imperial structures, it imparted a new sense of religious community, often uniting the conquerors and the conquered. Islamic scholars resurrected the works of Greek philosophers and scientists that had languished forgotten for centuries, translating them into Arabic, and beautiful mosques began to adorn the towns. Areas that had been marginalized under the Byzantine or Sassanid Empires now found themselves at the heart of a new, vibrant civilization.
Success, however, brought its 
own problems for Islam. Acquiring lands far more urbanized than Arabia meant that the caliphs had to adapt from being warrior chiefs commanding a tight-knit group of followers, to monarchs ruling over a huge area with complex economies and societies. In addition to this, Muslims were initially in the minority, and not wholly united.
Growing divisions
Tensions over the succession to the caliphate resulted in a major schism in Islam. A struggle between Ali, Muhammad’s son-in-law, and Muawiya, the Governor of Syria,  led to a civil war that ended in  Ali’s murder and Muawiya taking control of the caliphate in 661. While Muawiya’s descendants  (the Umayyads) ruled from the Syrian city of Damascus, Ali’s followers opposed their authority, claiming the caliph should be chosen from among Ali’s offspring. After the murder of Ali’s son Husayn at Karbala in 680, the split between the Shia (those who supported  the right of Ali’s descendents to rule the caliphate) and the more THE MEDIEVAL WORLD
mainstream Sunni (who rejected this) became definitive—a division that continues to this day. 
Islamic unity was fractured in 
other ways too; ruling over such a vast empire was almost impossible when messages from the eastern and western extremities might take months to reach the caliph’s court. Independent Muslim dynasties emerged in peripheral areas and rival caliphs appeared in the 10th century in Spain, Tunisia, and Egypt. Yet even though its political unity had been shattered, and its religious unity compromised, Muhammad’s creed was so popular and successful that by the 21st century there were about 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide.

 THE CROWNING OF CHARLEMAGNE (800)
On Christmas Day, 800 an 
extraordinary event took place at St. Peter’s Basilica, 
Rome. Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish King Charlemagne with an imperial diadem, coronating the first emperor in the west for three centuries. The imperial crown established Charlemagne and his successors as secular rivals to the Papacy’s claim (as spiritual head of the church) to a position of authority over western rulers. In due course, Charlemagne’s empire (which later became known as the Holy Roman Empire) expanded to cover a vast area and laid the foundations for some of the future nation-states  of Western Europe.

But as the new kingdoms, particularly that of the Franks, became stronger and more unified, Eastern Roman recognition ceased to matter. 
From kingdom to empire
Charlemagne, who came to the Frankish throne in 768, expanded his dominions extensively over time, conquering northern Italy  and Saxony, gaining some areas from the Arabs in northern Spain,  and taking Avar territories in the Danube. He strengthened Frankish administration, establishing a network of missi domenici —royal 
agents who would enforce his will in the provinces. For the first time  
in centuries, a powerful ruler controlled most of the former Western Roman Empire’s lands, turning them into a single political entity. By contrast, the Papacy had experienced difficult times in the 8th century, snared in petty power politics as various Roman noble families sought to secure positions in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. After Leo was assaulted in Rome  in 799, he fled across the Alps to seek help from Charlemagne, inviting him to bring order to  
Italy and restore the status of the church. A year later, Leo crowned Charlemagne, creating a Western emperor alongside the Eastern one.
Carolingian Renaissance
Charlemagne pushed forward his program of reforms, issuing an edict in 802 that required an oath of loyalty to be sworn and laying out the duties of his vassals. He also invited distinguished scholars to court, and encouraged academic disciplines that had languished since the collapse of the Roman Empire, including grammar, rhetoric, and astronomy. Music, literature, art, and architecture  also flourished during his reign. 
After Charlemagne’s death, 
divisions were rife. The Frankish custom of dividing the kingdom between several heirs weakened central authority and led to civil wars; it also allowed the emergence of powerful landowners, who often challenged royal authority. Ultimately, the empire split into  two main portions, which roughly equate to France and Germany today. The title of emperor was passed down to the immediate descendants of Charlemagne and then, from the 10th century, to  more distantly related German princes. In this form, as the Holy Roman Empire, it was to survive  to the early 19th century. 
■Charlemagne 
Charlemagne (c.747–814) was 
the eldest son of Pippin III, who in 751 deposed the last Merovingian king of the Franks and assumed the royal office himself. Energetic and visionary, Charlemagne greatly expanded the Frankish kingdom. He was also a very strong ruler, implementing reforms that enhanced the authority of the monarchy  
and the church. In addition,  
he reformed the kingdom’s economy by introducing  
a new monetary system, standardizing weights and measures, and unifying an array of different currencies  
to encourage commerce and trade. His acquisition of the imperial title in 800 further consolidated his power, but at first he made no plans to pass it on. His first decision on the succession, in 806, divided  
the realm between three of  
his sons but made no mention  
of the office of emperor. However, the deaths of two of his sons led Charlemagne to bequeath his lands and title to a single heir—Louis the Pious.He cultivated the  
liberal arts most studiously 
and, greatly respecting  
those who taught them,  
he granted them  
great honours.

The seeds of rebellion
Under Xuanzong (712–56), the Tang 
dynasty reached the zenith of its power and prestige, yet several key economic, social, and political issues threatened to destabilize it. 
Firstly, the state was struggling 
to raise sufficient taxes to fund a sharp rise in military expenditure. The fu-bing , the cost-effective and 
self-supporting national militia system in which soldiers worked the land when not required for active military duty, was proving inadequate in the face of repeated invasions by neighboring groups. Xuanzong was forced to establish military provinces along China’s northern frontiers, headed by local governors who commanded huge armies, and who came to acquire considerable power and autonomy. 
The Tang’s coffers were drained 
further by the failure of the “equal field” system, a program of land distribution and tax collection that protected small farmers from the depredations of wealthy landowners by periodically reallocating land to them. Its gradual demise enabled the nobility to grab land to increase their regional power bases, and led to unrest among the peasantry.
 Lastly, earlier reforms made by 
Emperor Taizong (reigned 626–649) to the examination system used to recruit civil servants, which opened it up to able men from humbler backgrounds without connections, had created a bureaucracy based on merit that eroded the power  and influence of the aristocracy. Xuanzong now had to manage rival factions in his court—potentially rebellious nobles, ambitious professional bureaucrats, and military governors, some of whom had begun to intervene in politics.
However, it was a series of 
military debacles that provided the spark for revolt against the Tang, including the defeat by Abbasid Arabs in 751 that halted China’s expansion into Central Asia.
Turning on the Tang
Discontent exploded among the military, which saw its position threatened now that the era of conquest was over. An Lushan,  a prominent military governor who had become a court favorite, rose up against his masters. Claiming that the emperor had asked him to remove Yang Guozhong (the court’s chief minister, with whom An Lushan was engaged in an intense power struggle), he mobilized a rebel army and marched south.
At first the revolt looked set for 
success: it captured the eastern capital, Luoyang, early in 756—where An Lushan declared a rival dynasty, the Yan—before storming Chang’an, the primary capital. Xuanzong fled from his court, only just escaping An Lushan’s clutches. 
After eight years of war, the 
Tang finally crushed the revolt, but the effort had fatally weakened it. Over the next century it lost more political power to the military, and further rebellions broke out. By 907, the empire had fragmented into local dynasties and kingdoms that vied for power for 50 years.

The rise of the Abbasids
After the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632, his successors ruled over a growing Islamic empire (or caliphate). Following the murder in 744 of the caliph al-Walid, a member of the Umayyad family that had ruled from Damascus since 661, civil war broke out, ending only when the Abbasid dynasty came to power in 750. The Abbasids spent their first decade pacifying the empire, with the help of troops from Khurasan in northeastern Iran. These troops, a mixture of Arab-speakers, Persians, and central Asians, had been among the Abbasids’ principal backers and had provided them with a power base independent of the Arab tribes based in northern Arabia, Syria, and Iraq who had supported the Umayyads. 
It was in part to provide land  
for his Khurasani soldiers that al-Mansur, the second Abbasid caliph, established the city of Baghdad in 762. He chose the site for its mild climate and its location on the trade routes between Persia, Arabia, and the Mediterranean.  
It was also just 20 miles to the southeast of the Persian royal seat  
at Ctesiphon, which it soon eclipsed, enabling the new dynasty to portray themselves as masters of a culture that stretched back to Cyrus the THE FOUNDING OF BAGHDAD

also acted as an academy for 
scholars and a center for the translation of key scientific works into Arabic. Among its leading scholars were Hunayn ibn Ishaq (808–873), a Nestorian Christian from al-Hira in Iraq, who translated more than 100 mostly medical and philosophical works; and Thabit ibn Qurra, a member of a pagan sect known as the Sabaeans, who translated Elements , Euclid’s  
great work on geometry, and the Almagest , Ptolemy’s key work  
on astronomy.
Translation became a highly 
prestigious endeavor. One Arab patron paid an extravagant 2,000 dinars a month to ensure his association with a translation of  a work by the Greek physician Galen (a dinar, made of pure gold, weighed the same as 72 grains of barley). Within around 150 years, almost all of the key Greek texts that had been discovered had been rendered into Arabic. Many of them were not available in Western Europe at all, and even if they had been, knowledge of Greek had all but disappeared there. The Muslim world was therefore well set by around 850 to build on the scientific traditions of Classical and Hellenistic Greeks transmitted and developed under the Roman Empire—and to acquire a centuries-long lead over Christian Western Europeans.

a refugee Umayyad prince who had 
escaped the Abbasid revolution, became a magnet for scholars  
from the East, and its libraries became a repository of precious ancient texts that had been translated into Arabic. 
In 967, the French cleric and 
scholar Gerbert of Aurillac (who in 999 would become Pope Sylvester II) arrived in Spain for a three-year period of study at a monastery in Catalonia. There he had access  to manuscripts that had filtered over the border from Muslim-held al-Andalus. He took back to France knowledge of Arabic technology such as the water clock and the astrolabe, and of a type of abacus that used a decimal system.  
This was the first example of the system’s use in medieval Europe.  
It was a small beginning, and one paralleled in southern Italy where a medical school was established at Salerno in the 9th century. A few Islamic manuscripts reached the school in the early years, but many more arrived in the late 11th century when Muslim doctor Constantine the African returned from Qairawan in Tunisia. He had gone there to study medicine, and brought back with him works such as the Complete Art of Medicine by Ali ibn al-Abbas al-Majusi (known  
in the West as Haly Abbas), parts  
of which he then translated into Latin. This translation gave Western doctors and scholars access to comparatively advanced Muslim medical knowledge.THE FOUNDING OF BAGHDAD
Classical Greek texts arrived directly from the Byzantine Empire to the West (in particular Pisa, which had a trading quarter in Constantinople), including works  by the philosopher Aristotle. The main channel for the transmission  of Islamic learning into Europe, however, continued to be Spain. As Islamic Spain shrank, pressurized by the Reconquista, the flow of materials accelerated. The Christian reconquest spread increasingly into Muslim emirates until, in 1085, Alfonso VI of Castile captured Toledo. The city became a center  
for the translation of Arabic works by an international group including the Englishman Herbert of Ketton, Slav Hermann of Carinthia, the Frenchman Raymond of Marseilles, Jewish scholar Abraham ibn Ezra, and Italian Gerhard of Cremona.  
In the mid-12th century, the group The ancient Greek thinker  Aristotle

translated many Arabic texts  
into Latin, including works on 
mathematics, medicine, and philosophy. Western Europe now had access to Ptolemy’s Almagest , 
and to the medical works of Galen, as well as access to new works by  Arabic writers who had built on  or summarized the work of their ancient predecessors, such as ibn Sina’s Canon of Medicine . This 
five-book encyclopedia became one of the most widely used treatises in European medical schools until the 16th century. 
Royal patronage 
This transmission of knowledge  
to the West mirrored the process  
by which the Islamic world had absorbed Greek learning during  
the great period of translation  
into Arabic in the 9th and 10th centuries. Noble and royal patrons played similar roles in both phases of the transmission. King Roger II  of Sicily (which by 1091 had been reconquered from the Muslims) invited Arab scholar al-Idrisi to his court in 1138 with a commission  
to construct a map of the world based on Islamic geographical  
and cartographic works. The result, which took more than 15 years to complete, was by far the most accurate world map yet available  to Europeans, and showed areas  as far east as Korea. The map  was accompanied by the Book of Pleasant Journeys into Faraway Lands , in which al-Idrisi’s royal 
patron could have read of wondrous things such as cannibals in Borneo, and the gold trade in Ghana.
A tradition of learning
Roger’s grandson Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor from 1220 until 1250, continued his grandfather’s tradition of sponsoring translations of Arabic texts. A remarkable polymath who knew at least four languages, Roger so impressed his contemporaries with his learning that he became known as Stupor Mundi (“the Marvel of the World”). Among his protégés were the Scottish scholar Michael Scot, who translated key works of Aristotle  on zoology, and the Pisan Leonardo Fibonacci, who had been sent  by his merchant family to study mathematics at Bougie in Muslim North Africa. There Fibonacci learned of the decimal system, and in 1202 he published the Book of Calculations , the most detailed 
account yet seen in Europe of the Arabic system of numbering.
By the early 13th century,  
the Abbasid Empire had all but collapsed. The difficulties of ruling such a far-flung empire and the effects of a series of civil wars had led to key provinces such as Spain, Tunisia, and Egypt breaking away to be ruled by their own caliphs. Even in Baghdad, where the Abbasid caliphs clung on, they were only notionally sovereign. Real power was held by other dynasties THE MEDIEVAL WORLD
such as the Shia Buyids, and, from 1055, the Seljuqs, a Turkish group originating in central Asia. The final blow was dealt by the Mongols, who surged westward into the Islamic world in the early 13th century.

The last ruling Abbasid caliph al-Musta’sim was executed, and political and cultural leadership of the Islamic world passed first to the Mamluks in Cairo and then, after their conquest of Egypt in 1517, to the Ottoman Turks.
By this time Europeans had 
rediscovered Greek and Roman learning in almost every field of scholarship through the medium of Arabic texts. It had taken centuries for the new material to be absorbed, and a further wave of interest in classical manuscripts in the 15th century to spark the Renaissance in Europe.

Anglo-Saxon Chronicle NEVER BEFORE

 APPEARED IN BRITAIN
 THE VIKING RAID ON LINDISFARNE ( 793)
On a calm June day in 793,  
a party of men landed on the shore of the holy island 
of Lindisfarne in northern England, and mounted a ferocious attack  on its monastery. The invaders murdered some of the monks, dragged others away into slavery, and plundered the church’s treasures before slipping away.
This unexpected assault was 
the first recorded raid by Vikings—pagan seafaring warriors from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden—and news of it sent waves of horror and fear across Christian Europe. Over the next 200 years, Vikings would ravage and loot settlements across large parts of the continent. But they were also colonists and traders with a sophisticated artistic culture who left a lasting imprint on the places they invaded and settled.
An unstoppable force 
Within six years of the Lindisfarne raid, bands of Vikings—or “Danes” as they were known in Anglo-Saxon England—were targeting the wealth of other Christian sites in England, Scotland, Ireland, and France. Key to the success of these missions was the Viking longship, a slender vessel with a shallow bottom that enabled its crew to sail far up waterways and alight stealthily on shores. Each ship could carry up to 80 warriors, recruited by a warlord whose authority depended on his military prowess and his success in capturing booty for his followers.
No single motive drove the 
Vikings to venture across the sea. In parts of Scandinavia, population growth may have forced young men into a piratical lifestyle; in others, perhaps the increasing strength of local clan leaders sparked power struggles that pushed the losers into exile. And the newly rich trading towns in northern Europe

 THE ROMAN 
CHURCH HAS 
NEVER ERRED
 THE INVESTITURE CONTROVERSY (1078)
For three days in 1078, the 
Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV stood penitent, barefoot 
in the snow outside the Italian fortress of Canossa, begging Pope Gregory VII for absolution. This event was the culmination of the Investiture Controversy, a struggle between the two men about the extent of secular authority over the Christian church, and the authority to appoint—or invest—bishops. 
Both king and pope were rulers 
of particular domains, but they also had rival symbolic claims to lead all Christendom. An emperor had to be crowned by the pope before he assumed the imperial title. Pope Gregory VII asserted that the pope’s authority was supreme in spiritual matters, and that even in secular affairs it stood far above that of worldly princes. 
When at last Gregory signaled 
forgiveness of the penitent emperor, it marked a bitter blow for imperial prestige and a huge triumph for the independence of the church.

and monarchs were appointing 
their own bishops, especially in Germany where the office often came with considerable territorial domains. The feeling that the church had lost touch with its roots was also widespread: monasteries had become storehouses of treasure, bishops were ruling their lands like secular lords, and clerical offices were openly sold. Itinerant preachers started to inveigh against these betrayals, and calls for reform were beginning to be heard from within the church itself. Gregory vigorously promoted papal authority, and in 1075 a church council declared that only the  pope had the power to appoint bishops or move them to a different area. Henry, facing the loss  of authority over large tracts of Germany, continued to appoint bishops and called for the pope to step down. Gregory retaliated by excommunicating the king and declaring him deposed. German nobles, already feeling discontented at Henry’s attempts to centralize power, felt that this released them from their oath of loyalty, and many rose up in revolt. Caught between the papacy and the nobles, Henry eventually chose to take the road to Canossa in a humiliating retreat.
Final agreement at Worms
But Henry’s submission did not last. The issue of investiture was not explicitly settled and underlying dispute caused partisans of pope and emperor to clash repeatedly until 1122, when Henry’s son  Henry V agreed to the Concordat  of Worms. Squeezed between an increasingly assertive insistence on papal supremacy, and the growing independence of the German nobles, the emperor conceded virtually all investiture rights.

and monarchs were appointing 
their own bishops, especially in Germany where the office often came with considerable territorial domains. The feeling that the church had lost touch with its roots was also widespread: monasteries had become storehouses of treasure, bishops were ruling their lands like secular lords, and clerical offices were openly sold. Itinerant preachers started to inveigh against these betrayals, and calls for reform were beginning to be heard from within the church itself. Gregory vigorously promoted papal authority, and in 1075 a church council declared that only the  pope had the power to appoint bishops or move them to a different area. Henry, facing the loss  of authority over large tracts of Germany, continued to appoint bishops and called for the pope to step down. Gregory retaliated by excommunicating the king and declaring him deposed. German nobles, already feeling discontented at Henry’s attempts to centralize power, felt that this released them from their oath of loyalty, and many rose up in revolt. Caught between the papacy and the nobles, Henry eventually chose to take the road to Canossa in a humiliating retreat.
Final agreement at Worms
But Henry’s submission did not last. The issue of investiture was not explicitly settled and underlying dispute caused partisans of pope and emperor to clash repeatedly until 1122, when Henry’s son  Henry V agreed to the Concordat  of Worms. Squeezed between an increasingly assertive insistence on papal supremacy, and the growing independence of the German nobles, the emperor conceded virtually all investiture rights.

 A MAN DESTINED TO 
BECOME MASTER OF  
 THE STATE
 MINAMOTO YORITOMO BECOMES SHOGUN (1192)
When in 1192 the 
Japanese clan leader Minamoto Yoritomo 
became the military commander-in-chief, or shogun, it marked the ascent to power of a Japanese military class, the samurai, and established a line of military rulers who would govern Japan for the next 750 years.
The Japanese imperial court 
had been dominated since the  mid-7th century by regents from the Fujiwara family, who had reduced the emperors to mere figureheads. The situation became entrenched after the capital moved (following the emperor) to Kyoto in 794.  
Non-Fujiwara nobles were denied preferment at court, so sought positions in the provinces. The gulf widened between the Kyoto-based bureaucrats and the regional nobility, the samurai, who assumed

become their principal weapon. IN CONTEXT

a dominant role in local government. 
The Kyoto court appointed the most talented samurai as governors (zuryo ), both to bind them to the 
imperial government and to prevent them from building their own power bases. However, the samurai developed loyalty to their extended family, or clan, and its leader rather than to the emperor, and fought one another from their power bases in the provinces. The Minamoto and Taira clans engaged in a series of these struggles which culminated in the Gempei War, during which the Taira were utterly crushed.
The shogunate
Following his victory, clan leader Minamoto Yoritomo established  a parallel government based at Kamakura, about 250 miles east  of Kyoto. Other clan chieftains became his vassals or gokenin ,  
and he dispatched military estate governors to cement his control over the provinces. In 1192, Yoritomo accepted from the emperor the title of shogun, becoming the de facto military ruler of Japan. 
Over the following centuries, 
the emperors made periodic vain attempts to reassert authority over the shogunate, but the shoguns in turn could not maintain control of the samurai and their warlords, who controlled their areas and fought among themselves. Japan dissolved into a patchwork of military warlords or daimyo , each 
with its own power base and retinue of samurai warriors. 
Establishment of the office of 
shogun, which had seemed to offer Japan stability in 1192, ultimately led to the Sengoku, a civil war lasting almost 150 years. This war ended with the reunification of Japan under the new shogunate  of Tokugawa in 1603.

On June 15, 1215, King  
John of England signed  a charter at Runnymede,  
a meadow beside the Thames. Designed to make peace between the king and a group of rebel barons, the Magna Carta, as a form of the document became known, at first seemed ineffectual. However, its assertion of the rights of subjects against arbitrary actions of the Crown—the essential principle  
of the rule of law—provided a blueprint which, more than eight centuries later, is still viewed as a fundamental guarantee of rights  in the US and elsewhere. 
Feudal society
When King John acceded in 1199, England was a feudal society, a land-based hierarchy headed by the king, who owned all the land. The tenants-in-chief (or barons) received land from the king in exchange for loyalty and military service. They in turn leased the land to their own armed retainers, who leased to peasants, or villeins. Yet monarchs, especially in England, were levying an ever-increasing series of taxes and additional financial burdens on their barons. English kings from Henry I (1100–1135) onward also sought to centralize administration, partly by establishing a series of royal courts. These royal courts raised revenue for the Crown through fines and charges—but at the expense of the barons, who had previously raised those funds from their own local tribunals.
The exactions of King John
The barons’ discontent at these growing demands intensified under King John. Ruinously expensive campaigns against the French in 1200–04 had already resulted in the loss of Normandy (and earned the The Magna Carta included clauses 
relating to royal forests: the barons aimed to limit the king’s rights under England’s Forest Law, regulate forest boundaries, and investigate officials. IN CONTEXT

king the mocking nickname 
“Lackland”). Scutage, a further  
cash levy that left many barons in debt to money-lenders, was bitterly resented. Not only was the king proving lamentably unsuccessful  in war, but he had also broken the unspoken contract between himself and the barons, that allowed them to run their lands as they chose. 
Hoping for support from the 
pope, who had excommunicated John in 1209, the rebellious barons confronted the king. Attempts at diplomacy failed, and by May 1215, the barons had occupied London, forcing John to enter into a treaty with them to avoid a civil war. After careful direction of negotiations by Archbishop Stephen Langton of Canterbury, the agreement—more  
a truce than a peace—was signed.
Provisions of the charter
The charter was known as the Magna Carta, or Great Charter, to distinguish it from a more restricted Forest Charter issued in 1217. Much of the Magna Carta dealt with redressing baronial grievances,  as arrest or confiscation of land. The charter survived the civil war that broke out soon after the Magna Carta was agreed, and the papal repudiation of the charter’s terms  in August 1215, which led to the barons’ excommunication. Chapter 39 was extended under a 1354 law of Edward III to protect not only “free men” (a small minority in England where most people were technically serfs), but also any man “of whatever estate or condition  
he may be.” It survived longer  
than most of the other provisions, including the security clause that allowed barons to seize all the king’s land if he failed to fulfil his obligations under the agreement. 
What had seemed a small 
concession that day in Runnymede provided a long-lasting rallying cry for opponents of royal tyranny.
 ■ Influence of the Magna Carta
The Magna Carta has acquired 
an almost mythical status as  
the constitutional bedrock of subjects’ rights. It contributed to the development of parliament from the 13th century, and was used by 17th-century rebels to argue against the divine right  of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs Charles I and James II. Several American colonies’ charters contained clauses modeled on it, while  
the design of the Massachusetts seal chosen at the start of the Revolutionary War depicts a militiaman with sword in one hand and the Magna Carta in the other. Revolutionary feeling was fueled by Americans’  belief that the Crown had breached the fundamental law enjoyed by all English subjects, and both the United States Constitution, enacted in 1789, and the Bill of Rights adopted two years later, were influenced by the Magna Carta’s limitations on the arbitrary powers of a government against its subjects.but the section that has exerted  
the most influence down the ages was Chapter 39. This open-ended clause protected all “free men” from arbitrary actions by the Crown such Rights of individuals  
against arbitrary 
 punishment by the  
Crown are established.Financial demands  
to fund wars  
in France increase.Centralization

In March 1279, Mongol warriors 
swept through southern China, capturing the last strongholds 
of the Chinese Song dynasty. This defeat, which heralded the start  of the Yuan dynasty, marked the culmination of the Mongols’ rise  in under 70 years from an obscure nomadic group from the Central Asian steppes to the masters of a vast empire stretching from China to eastern Europe. One of the major challenges they now faced was to make the transition from roving tribesmen to settled conquerors. 
The rise of the Mongols
At the start of the 13th century,  the Mongols had consisted of many different warring clans. However,  
in 1206 Temüjin—later known as Genghis Khan—proclaimed himself the ruler of a united Mongol nation. Shrewd and ruthless, Genghis diverted his people from inter-clan warfare and directed their energies to the more lucrative business of invading—first neighboring tribes in the steppes, then more organized states such as Persia, Russia, and northern China (1219–23). He gave the Mongol hordes a proper military structure and exploited the skills they had learned from their nomadic lifestyle: as expert horsemen, the soldiers were masters of mobile warfare and able to descend with devastating force and lightning speed on their opponents.
The Mongols’ rule in China
Genghis’s grandson Kublai Khan ruled China from 1260, but the challenges of mediating between the nomadic traditions of the Mongols and the complex culture  of the conquered proved difficult. 
Paper money was invented by the 
Chinese c.800. By the Yuan dynasty, banknotes (such as the one above from 1287) were issued by the government. IN CONTEXT

The old informal hierarchies of  
the steppes no longer sufficed to administer a land that contained great cities, and the immediate rewards of plunder were replaced by the deferred benefits gained  by good governance and taxation. As a result, many Mongols missed the old ways. To appease his fellow Mongols, Kublai gave them greater rights and privileges than the native Chinese. Meanwhile, to gain favor with the traditional Chinese elites, he promoted Confucian scholars, funded Taoist temples, and had his son educated in Buddhist scripture. He also set up schools for peasants and introduced the Mongol postal system of using horses and relay stations to link up the empire, which benefited the merchants.
The end of the empire
The need to restore stability in northern China delayed Kublai’s attempts to subjugate the Song  in the south until 1268. Although ultimately successful, the 11-year campaign was ruinously costly.  To preserve their warrior identity, the Mongols needed the spoils of conquest to fund their huge army. Kublai’s successors failed to work out how to preserve their identity while also keeping their monopoly of power, and the Mongol military gradually declined. After decades of famine, lethal epidemics, and corruption at court, in 1368 the heirs of Kublai were defeated in  a rebellion led by Zhu Yuanzhang, founder of the Ming dynasty. After more than a century of occupation, China was back in the hands of the native (Han) Chinese.

Mongol revival of the route
By the 13th century, empires that had controlled sections of the Silk Road had fragmented. This left  
the route less secure for travelers, and so deterred merchants from using it. However, following Mongol conquest of the area between 1205 and 1269, the area was controlled—if loosely—by a single authority, the Great Khan, so a merchant could travel from Khanbalik (Beijing) to Baghdad without leaving Mongol territory. This renewed stability encouraged a revival of trade.
At around this time, European 
merchants’ horizons were also expanding. In the early Middle Ages, traders could work only locally, and transport their goods to points where they might connect to longer-distance trade routes. From the  
12th century, Italian city States  
such as Pisa, Genoa, and Venice, pioneered maritime trade across the eastern Mediterranean, which enabled merchants to connect directly with sea routes that linked West Asia and Egypt to China via the Indian Ocean.
The profits for merchants taking 
advantage of the “Pax Mongolica,” or Mongol peace, could be huge.  In the late 13th century, the costs  
of setting up a caravan might amount to 3,500 florins, but the cargo, once sold in China, could yield seven times that sum, and  
by 1326 Genoese traders were a common sight in the principal Chinese port of Zaitun.  
Decline of land trade
The Silk Road flourished for another century, but the collapse of the Mongol Ilkhanate of Persia in 1335, and the overthrow in 1368 of the Yuan, the Mongol ruling dynasty  in China, once again left the route divided between politically weak powers. It was also blocked to European traders at the western end by the growth of the Muslim Ottoman Empire. 
A taste of the profits of long-
distance trade in luxury goods encouraged European powers  
to seek alternatives to the now defunct Silk Road, this time by  sea. In 1514, Portuguese merchants arrived off the coast of China, near Guangzhou, eager to take up the direct trading links with China that had been pioneered two and a half centuries earlier by their illustrious predecessor, Marco Polo.

At just 17 years old, Marco 
Polo (1254–1324) set off from Venice to the court of the Mongol ruler, Kublai Khan.  
He traveled with his father and uncle, who had previously visited China and been entrusted by Kublai with a message for the pope. Polo was received with great favor at the Mongol court and stayed in China for 17 years. He traveled extensively throughout the country in the Khan’s service, leaving for home at last in around 1291. 
During a naval battle in 
1298, Polo was captured and imprisoned by the Genoese. The stories he told of his sojourn in the lands of the Great Khan attracted the attention of his cell mate, Rustichello, who wrote them down, embellishing them as he went along. The resulting book was translated into many languages and includes much invaluable information about late-13th-century  
China. After his release, Polo returned to Venice, where he lived for the rest of his life.

 THE FALL OF JERUSALEM (1099)
On July 15, 1099, some 
15,000 Christian knights surged into Jerusalem 
after a month-long siege. The victorious crusaders slaughtered Muslim defenders and Jews alike  in a bloody act that marked the beginning of 200 years of Muslim–Christian warfare in the Holy Land.
Defending Christianity
Jerusalem had fallen into Muslim hands in 639. Neither the Byzantine emperors in Constantinople nor the Christian kings in Western Europe had the political willpower or the strength to reverse the conquest, although the city was sacred to both.In the 11th century, however, the advances of a new group, the Seljuk Turks, disrupted the pilgrimage routes to Jerusalem, and the  
Turks’ defeat of the Byzantines  at Manzikert threatened to push the frontiers of Christianity back  to the gates of Constantinople. In 1095, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos sent emissaries to Pope Urban II asking for help to bolster the Byzantine retaliation.Victorious crusaders flooded into 
Jerusalem, and in a ruthless assault seized the city from the Fatimid caliphate, laying the foundations  for a new kingdom.IN CONTEXT

The Just War
Pope Urban readily seized a cause 
that would enhance papal prestige. In a sermon of 1095, he described atrocities against Christians in the Holy Land, calling for an expedition to free them. Christian warriors rallied to the cause, eager to gain both salvation and plunder by joining a so-called Just War in God’s name. 
Some 100,000 crusading knights, 
mostly French and Norman, set out in 1096. Progress to Jerusalem was slow: the crusaders suffered several setbacks at the hands of the Seljuk Turks, and the long siege of Antioch severely tested their morale, yet they pressed on and, led by the French knight Godfrey of Bouillon, at last captured the Holy City. 
In the area they had conquered,  
the crusaders established four states, at Edessa, Antioch, Tripoli, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem, known collectively as Outremer.  To withstand the vigorous Muslim counter-attacks, the crusaders built a dense network of fortresses such as Beaufort, Margat, and Krak  
des Chevaliers, which dominated strategic routes into the Holy Land. As the initial crusading impulse waned, Outremer began to suffer from a shortage of manpower. This was partly resolved by the founding of crusading orders such as the Templars and Hospitaller knights, organizations who swore monastic vows to defend the Holy Land.

However, even this was not enough, and when Muslim armies captured Edessa in 1144, a Second Crusade was called. This, and the Emperor Alexios appeals

By 1270 there had been eight 
further crusades, and the movement had extended to include attacks on Muslims in North Africa; joining the Reconquista (the Christian reconquest of Islamic emirates  in Spain); launching expeditions against pagan groups in eastern Europe, and even Christian heretics, such as the Cathars in southern France. In the Middle East, however, the emergence of stronger Muslim states, such as the Mamluks in Egypt, able to mount a strong resistance to crusader pressure, rendered the later expeditions largely ineffectual.

In the early 12th century, much  
of mainland Southeast Asia,  
including Cambodia, and parts 
of Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand, was 
controlled by the Khmer Empire from its capital at Angkor (in the northeast of present-day Cambodia)—an impressive urban complex with residential areas, temples, and a network of water reservoirs, built by a succession of god-kings who ruled as the earthly representatives of the Hindu god Shiva. 
Around 1120, the Khmer king 
Suryavarman II commissioned an ambitious new construction project—a 200-hectare (500-acre) temple complex dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu that would also record the king’s achievements. His spectacular Angkor Wat, completed 37 years later, was enclosed by a huge moat, adorned with lotus-shaped towers, and decorated with an 2,600ft-long (800m) gallery of fine bas-reliefs depicting scenes from Hindu mythology and the king as the embodiment of Vishnu.  
Angkor Wat is a testament to 
the remarkable productivity and creativity of one of the greatest powers in Southeast Asia’s history, yet its construction also marked  the onset of its decline, as later kings faced foreign invasions, shifts in trade, and wars with rival kingdoms that shrunk its territory. The empire’s fortunes were revived under Jayavarman VII, who made Mahyanana Buddhism the state religion, and initiated a building spree at Angkor, but his death in 1218 left it fatally weakened.

While the Khmer Empire held sway in mainland Southeast Asia, in

Over time, it had grown rich from its trade in the spices, especially nutmeg, that Europe, India, and China craved, but by the end of the 12th century it had been reduced to a small kingdom, and was later eclipsed by the Majapahit in Java. 
In the late 13th century, Mongol

In the early 1400s, the empire contracted further as armies from Champa (now in Vietnam)  and Ayutthaya (now in Thailand)—seized more of its land. In 1431,  the latter took Angkor, and the capital was later relocated to the coast, leaving Suryavarman’s spiritual masterpiece to be reclaimed by the jungle.

Suryavarman was a warlike leader, waging campaigns in what is now Vietnam against the Dai-Viet between 1123 and 1136, and against the Khmer’s traditional enemy to the east, Champa, in 1145. He also pushed the empire’s boundaries deep into Thailand and made advances against the Pagan kingdom of Myanmar.

 MANSA MUSA’S HAJJ  TO MECCA (1324)
The Muslim West African 
kingdom of Mali burst  onto the world stage with  
a flourish in the early 14th century, when its fabulously wealthy ruler, Mansa Musa, made an unusually extravagant hajj  (pilgrimage) to 
Mecca, supported by the huge profits made by Mali’s control of the trans-Saharan caravan trade. The emperor’s year-long expedition became legendary in the Muslim world, and even in Europe, and  his subsequent promotion of Islamic culture and learning in  his kingdom was symbolic of the faith’s gradual infiltration of the trading empires of West Africa.

beginning with the Kingdom of 
Ghana, which became known as “the land of gold,” a reference to the source of its huge wealth. In the 7th century, the Arab conquest of North Africa gave a new impetus to trans-Saharan trade—the Muslim states had a huge appetite for West African gold and slaves. As this trade grew, Muslim merchants, and with them Islam, were drawn to the area between the headwaters of the Niger and Senegal rivers.
However, peaceful trading was 
soon followed by conquest. The Almoravids, a Moroccan Berber dynasty, swept south in 1076 and sacked Ghana’s capital, shattering its authority over the region. 
Ghana’s reduced power opened 
up a vacuum that was gradually filled by Mali, a state founded around the Upper Niger River, which began to expand in the mid-13th century. Under Mansa Musa (ruled 1312–37), Mali reached its greatest extent and power, having forged highly lucrative caravan connections with Egypt and other important trade centers in North Africa. Gold, salt, and slaves were taken north in exchange for textiles and manufactured goods.
A center of scholarship
Mansa Musa was not the first  
West African ruler to make a hajj   
to Mecca, but the huge scale of  
his entourage—more than 60,000 people, including 500 slaves who bore staffs of pure gold—impressed his observers, and was a potent expression of his wealth.

beginning with the Kingdom of 
Ghana, which became known as “the land of gold,” a reference to the source of its huge wealth. In the 7th century, the Arab conquest of North Africa gave a new impetus to trans-Saharan trade—the Muslim states had a huge appetite for West African gold and slaves. As this trade grew, Muslim merchants, and with them Islam, were drawn to the area between the headwaters of the Niger and Senegal rivers.
However, peaceful trading was 
soon followed by conquest. The Almoravids, a Moroccan Berber dynasty, swept south in 1076 and sacked Ghana’s capital, shattering its authority over the region. 
Ghana’s reduced power opened 
up a vacuum that was gradually filled by Mali, a state founded around the Upper Niger River, which began to expand in the mid-13th century. Under Mansa Musa (ruled 1312–37), Mali reached its greatest extent and power, having forged highly lucrative caravan connections with Egypt and other important trade centers in North Africa. Gold, salt, and slaves were taken north in exchange for textiles and manufactured goods.
A center of scholarship
Mansa Musa was not the first  
West African ruler to make a hajj   
to Mecca, but the huge scale of  
his entourage—more than 60,000 people, including 500 slaves who bore staffs of pure gold—impressed his observers, and was a potent expression of his wealth.

Hondurus, Nicaragua, and northern 
Costa Rica. This progress was paralleled by the growth at much the same time of Cuzco, the capital of the Incas—an Andean people of humble beginnings, who in just a few decades created the largest state South America had yet seen.
Aztec foundations
The Aztecs may have begun their wanderings in northern Mexico around 1200. For the next 100 years they eked out a miserable existence as mercenaries or barely tolerated squatters, their plight not aided by their reputation as cruel warriors. Frequently, they had to flee after committing violent acts, at times involving human sacrifice; indeed, their flight to Tenochtitlan was prompted by one such incident. The Aztecs had asked their host, the lord of Culhuacán, whether he would give his daughter as a bride for their chief. He agreed, believing she would be greatly honored as queen; however, to his horror they killed and flayed her as a sacrifice to their deity Xipe Totec. Driven out by the lord and his soldiers, the Aztecs fled southward toward the future site of Tenochtitlan.  
Although the soil around Lake 
Texcoco, on which the island of Tenochtitlan was situated, was marshy and there was very little timber available, the capital was easily defensible and the Aztecs used it to consolidate their position. Initially shielded by a treaty with the Tepanec ruler Tezozomoc, who dominated the Valley of Mexico from 1371 to 1426, the Aztecs went on to form a Triple Alliance with the cities of Texcoco and Tlacopan in 1428—a union that kick-started a period of imperial expansion.

Before long, they had built a temple that became the nucleus of their capital, Tenochtitlan. Within two centuries, the city was the center  of the most predominant empire in  the history of Mesoamerica—a large region that shared a pre-Columbian culture and extended from modern-day central Mexico southward to Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador,

The imperial system
Tenochtitlan was adorned by many temples to the gods of the Aztec pantheon. Each god had their own temple, with the Templo Mayor having twin shrines dedicated to Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc, the rain god. At these temples a stream of human victims was sacrificed—up to 80,000 at the rededication of the Templo Mayor in 1487—by burning alive, decapitation, or cutting open the chest and removing the heart.

each year. The empire depended on 
this tribute to reward the nobility and the warriors, who ensured that the towns subjugated by the Aztecs remained submissive—little mercy being shown to those who revolted. 
While the Aztecs provided some 
security to their subjects, they gave little else. At Tenochtitlan, artificial islands ( chinampas ) were created at 
great expense to expand the land available to produce food, but no such works were carried out for the subject cities. Defeated states did not provide troops for the Aztec army, and so did not share in the spoils of future victory, and little effort was made to propagate the Aztec language. It was an empire built on fear and in the end it proved brittle: when it was invaded by a small party of Spaniards led by Cortes in 1519, the subject peoples rallied to the newcomers rather than defending the Aztecs, and the empire collapsed within two years.
Inca beginnings
The Incas, whose heartland lay high in the central Andes around Cuzco, in modern-day Peru, had similarly humble origins to the Aztecs, but their rise to imperial status was, if anything, even more meteoric. They began as a small, somewhat disregarded tribe and developed their own strategies  to co-opt neighboring groups  into a successful empire. 
The Incas’ origin myth told of 
their emergence from a cave in the high mountains, from where their first leader—Manco Capac—led  his people to Cuzco. It is generally believed that the Incas arrived in the region around 1200, and for two centuries they remained a relatively THE FOUNDATION OF TENOCHTITLAN
insignificant farming group, with their society divided up into clans (ayllus ) of roughly equal status. 
Inca expansion
The Incas began to make their mark as a major power around 1438, when the neighboring Chanca people attempted to push the Incas out of the Cuzco valley. By this time, the Incas had a supreme leader  (the Sapa Inca), and although the incumbent Viracocha was unequal to the task, his son Pachacuti defeated the invaders, and then led Inca armies to conquer the rest of the Cuzco valley and the southern highlands around Lake Titicaca. Under Pachacuti’s son Topa Inca Yupanqui and grandson Huayna Capac, the Incas overcame Chimor (the largest coastal state) in about 1470. They then absorbed the rest of the northern highlands and extended to parts of modern-day Ecuador and Colombia and south  to the deserts north of Chile. 
Unlike the Aztecs, the Incas 
recruited troops from among the conquered peoples (placed under the command of Inca officers), thus providing them with the lure of plunder in return for their loyalty.
Inca communication
The empire of the Incas was highly centralized; censuses recorded the number of peasants, who all owed labor service ( mitad ) to the Sapa 
Inca. This level of organization enabled the construction of public works on a vast scale. Particularly vital was the extensive road network, which extended nearly 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers) long and was dotted at regular intervals with resthouses that facilitated rapid transit for the  army and provided a very efficient system of communication across the far-flung Inca domains. At the If the land [Peru] had not been

Tlacaelel 
As the Aztec Empire expanded 
and conquered new territories, it became increasingly necessary to create a more complex system of administration. After Itzcoatl became ruler ( tlatoani ) in 1427, 
he introduced the new post of chief adviser ( cihuacoatl ). The 
office’s first incumbent was Itzcoatl’s nephew, Tlacaelel (1397–1487), who held the office until his death. Tlacaelel served through several reigns and he provided invaluable continuity. In addition, he created impetus for his reforms (mostly benefiting the royal family and nobles) by ordering the destruction of earlier chronicles and the rewriting of Aztec history to establish the basis of Aztec imperial ideology.
He also presided over the 
formation of the Triple Alliance, solidifying the Aztec position and ensuring a steady stream  
of sacrificial victims. Given that Tlacaelel was never the Aztec’s ruler, his immense influence in Tenochtitlan shows that the Aztec system of authority was not as monolithic as it might  
at first appear.

same time, the Inca domestication 
of the llama as a beast of burden made it easier to transport heavy loads across the empire. 
Unlike the Aztecs, the Incas 
actively sought to spread their own language (Quechua) and system of religious beliefs, which was initially based around the worship of Inti (the sun god), but which came to feature prominently Viracocha—a supreme creation god and therefore considered a more suitable deity for a conquering power. They also dispatched colonists ( miqmaq), 
shifting troublesome groups into more pacified areas to dilute their resistance and creating networks  of loyal settlers on the fringes of  the empire. Although definitive population statistics are not known, by the early 16th century the Inca Empire—which the Incas called Tawintusuyu ( “The Realm of Four Quarters”)—consisted of about 4–6 million people in total, operating to the advantage of the Inca minority and their subjects. 
Despite its many strengths,  
the highly centralized nature of  the Inca Empire proved fatal in the early 1530s, when Spanish invaders led by Pizarro captured the Sapa Inca Atahuallpa; without their leader, the Incas rapidly collapsed.

releasing a large proportion of their population to fight in the armies that conducted their campaigns of expansion. They also reorganized the traditional tribal structure to favor a warrior and noble elite.  In both cases, the momentum of conquest demanded further wars  to reward the warrior caste or to provide an incentive for newly conquered peoples to remain loyal and thus to gain the rewards of participation in new campaigns.
Neither the Aztecs nor the Incas 
survived long enough to govern after their expansion slowed down. Had they done so, they might have developed strategies to bring long-term stability to their empires, or might have declined to the status  of competing city-states fighting to control limited resources. Instead, the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs in 1521 and their defeat of the last Incas by 1572 put paid to the ambitions of both empires and left the Spanish firmly established as colonial rulers in the region for the next 300 years.

 THE OUTBREAK OF THE BLACK DEATH  
IN EUROPE (1347)
In late November 1347, a galley 
entered the Italian port of Genoa, having fled a Tatar 
siege of Kaffa in the Crimea. It bore a deadly cargo: the bubonic plague. Within a mere two years, this lethal pestilence had killed more than a third of the population of Europe and the Middle East, and altered the regions’ economic, social, and religious makeup forever.
Spread of the Black Death
Having probably originated in Central Asia or western China  in the 1330s, the plague’s initial progress westward was slow,  but after it reached Crimea and Constantinople in 1347 it spread rapidly along maritime trade routes. Having hit Genoa, it appeared quickly in Sicily and Marseilles; by 1348 it had struck Spain, Portugal, and England, and it reached Germany and Scandinavia by 1349. 
The epidemic’s main vector was 
infected fleas and the rats that harbored them, both of which flourished in the unsanitary conditions of the time. The main symptoms of the disease were swellings, known as buboes, that appeared in the groin, neck, or armpits. These were followed by black blotches on the skin (hence “Black Death”) and then, in around three-quarters of cases, by death.
Contemporaries ascribed the 
causes of the pestilence variously to divine punishment for immorality, adverse conjunctions of the planets, earthquakes, or bad vapors. There was no cure, but preventive advice included abstinence from hard-to-digest food, the use of aromatic herbs to purify the air, and—the only effective measure—avoiding the company of others. 
More than a hundred million 
people may have died of the plague; estimates put the world population

at 450 million before it arrived, and 
350 million afterward. Its effects were more deadly in some areas than in others—in Egypt, about  40 percent of the population are thought to have died. Populations did not reach pre-plague levels again for nearly three centuries.
Reactions to the plague
Survivors reacted in varying ways. Jewish communities in Germany were accused of causing the plague  by poisoning wells, and many were attacked. In Strasbourg alone, 2,000 Jews were killed. 
With the population diminished, 
landholdings fell vacant, labor became scarce, and peasants’ bargaining power increased.  By 1350, English laborers could demand five times the wages they had asked in 1347, and tenants were paying rent in cash rather than with compulsory labor. Governments tried to clamp down on wages—the 1351 Statute of Labourers aimed to freeze rates at 1346 levels—but peasants responded with outbursts such as the Jacquerie in France in 1358, and the Peasants’ Revolt in England in 1381.
By the time it ended, the Black 
Death had killed proportionately  as many clergy as laity, and some clergy deserted their posts. As a result the church’s authority, like that of the nobility, was greatly weakened. The plague had loosened the ties that had previously bound medieval society together, leaving a freer and more volatile population to face the challenges posed by  
the Renaissance, Reformation,  and the economic expansion of  the 16th and 17th centuries.

The plague’s catastrophic toll 
cast a long shadow over contemporary social attitudes. A landscape of mass graves, abandoned villages, and an all-pervading fear of death deepened the sense that God had abandoned his people, and diluted the claims of traditional morality. Crime rose: the incidence of murder in England doubled in two decades from 1349. Flagellants roamed the countryside, scourging themselves with knotted ropes, until a Papal bull banned the practice in 1349.

at 450 million before it arrived, and 
350 million afterward. Its effects were more deadly in some areas than in others—in Egypt, about  40 percent of the population are thought to have died. Populations did not reach pre-plague levels again for nearly three centuries.
Reactions to the plague
Survivors reacted in varying ways. Jewish communities in Germany were accused of causing the plague  by poisoning wells, and many were attacked. In Strasbourg alone, 2,000 Jews were killed. 
With the population diminished, 
landholdings fell vacant, labor became scarce, and peasants’ bargaining power increased.  By 1350, English laborers could demand five times the wages they had asked in 1347, and tenants were paying rent in cash rather than with compulsory labor. Governments tried to clamp down on wages—the 1351 Statute of Labourers aimed to freeze rates at 1346 levels—but peasants responded with outbursts such as the Jacquerie in France in 1358, and the Peasants’ Revolt in England in 1381.
By the time it ended, the Black 
Death had killed proportionately  as many clergy as laity, and some clergy deserted their posts. As a result the church’s authority, like that of the nobility, was greatly weakened. The plague had loosened the ties that had previously bound medieval society together, leaving a freer and more volatile population to face the challenges posed by  
the Renaissance, Reformation,  and the economic expansion of  the 16th and 17th centuries.

The plague’s catastrophic toll 
cast a long shadow over contemporary social attitudes. A landscape of mass graves, abandoned villages, and an all-pervading fear of death deepened the sense that God had abandoned his people, and diluted the claims of traditional morality. Crime rose: the incidence of murder in England doubled in two decades from 1349. Flagellants roamed the countryside, scourging themselves with knotted ropes, until a Papal bull banned the practice in 1349.

Zhu reigned as emperor Hongwu (“Vastly Martial”—a reference to  his military prowess) from 1368 until his death in 1398, by which time he had firmly established one of China’s most influential, but also  most authoritarian, dynasties. He and his successors brought three centuries of prosperity and stability to the country, establishing its government and bureaucracy in a form that would endure, with slight modifications, until the demise  of the imperial system in 1911, and broadening the base of its economy.
Driving out the Mongols
Zhu’s new dynasty arose from  the chaos that accompanied the decline of the Yuan. In the 1340s and 50s, factionalism in the Mongol court, rampant government corruption, and a series of natural disasters, including plagues and epidemics, resulted in wholesale breakdown in law and order and administration as peasant groups rose up against their faltering HONGWU FOUNDS THE MING DYNASTY

Reform and despotism 
Zhu’s first priority as emperor Hongwu was to establish order—decades of conflict had ravaged China and impoverished its rural population. His humble beginnings may have influenced some of his early policies: responsibility for tax assessment was entrusted to rural communities, sweeping away the problem of rapacious tax collectors who had preyed on poorer areas; slavery was abolished; many large estates were confiscated; and lands owned by the state in the under-populated north of the country were handed to landless peasants, to encourage them to settle there. 
From 1380, Hongwu instituted 
government reforms that gave him personal control over all matters of state. After executing his prime minister, who had been implicated in a plot to overthrow him, he abolished the prime ministership and the central secretariat and  had the heads of the next layer of government, the six ministeries,  report directly to him, ensuring he oversaw even minor decisions. 
From then on, Hongwu acted  
as his own prime minister. His workload was almost unbearable—in a single week-long stint, he  had to scrutinize and approve  some 1,600 documents—and as  a result, the state became incapable of responding swiftly to crises. Although in time a new

grand secretariat emerged—an 
advisory board through which  the emperor responded to the six ministries and other government agencies—the Ming retained  a more autocratic and highly centralized structure than that of previous Chinese dynasties. This was reflected in the protocol of the Ming court, too: under the Song dynasty (960–1279), the emperor’s advisers had stood before him to discuss matters of state, but under the Ming they were required to kowtow —kneel and knock their 
heads to the floor—before him, a reverential acknowledgment of his absolute power and superiority.
Curbing the military
In the later years of the Yuan dynasty, the state had been torn apart by competing power bases outside the central court, and in a bid to avoid this scenario, Hongwu diluted the strength of the army. Although he adopted the Yuan military system—establishing garrisons in key cities, particularly along the northern frontier, where the threat of nomad incursions  was ever-present, and creating a hereditary caste of soldiers that supported itself on land granted  by the government—he also ensured that military units were periodically rotated through the capital for training, and that a group of centrally selected officers shared authority in the army with the garrison commanders, thus preventing the rise of influential warlords with a strong local base. 
Perfecting the civil service
Hongwu also had a deep mistrust  of the elite scholar class that had been at the heart of government for centuries. However, he was aware that they played a vital role in the efficient running of the state, and The Forbidden City —the imperial palace  
in Beijing—adhered to hierarchic Confucian 
ideology: the higher one’s social status, the further one could enter into the city.

had five gates. The central one was always reserved for the emperor.

5 The Palace of Heavenly Purity  
To fool assassins, the palace had nine bedrooms: the emperor slept in a different one each night. 5

so he promoted education and 
trained scholars specifically for the bureaucracy. In 1373, he suspended the traditional examinations used to recruit civil servants and ordered the establishment of local county and prefectural schools. From  these, the best candidates would be called for further study at a national university in the capital, where eventually 10,000 students from the original intake were enrolled. The civil service examinations were restored in 1385, when the emperor considered the well-trained graduates of the university ready to take them, and were so competitive that soldiers were stationed outside the cubicles where the examinees sat to avoid any collaboration or illicit use of reference materials. 
The pool of potential recruits 
into the administration was thus widened, but civil servants still received a very conservative education based on the Four Books and Five Classics of Confucianism and a selection of neo-Confucian works that expounded the virtues of loyalty to the emperor and adherence to Chinese tradition. Innovation was discouraged and bureaucrats became set in their ways. Those who were perceived  as having stepped outside their brief were publicly flogged, sometimes to death. 
This maltreatment of public 
servants was a sign of the cruel side of Hongwu’s personality. He was also violently paranoid, and vicious in his suppression of dissent. In 1382, he established  a secret police, the Embroidered Brocade Guard, whose 16,000 officers stamped out all signs of resistance. The Guard’s reach and

China’s domination over the area 
by exacting tribute and other gestures of homage to the emperor. 
The later Ming
However, the enormous cost of Zheng He’s ambitious ventures put great strain on the treasury, and  to ensure they would never be repeated, all records relating to them were destroyed. Official ideology regarded China as the center of the world, and the later Ming saw no reason to encourage further maritime contact. The Chinese did not regard relations with foreign powers as possible on an equal basis: where diplomatic relations were conducted, the foreigners were considered (by the Ming, at least) as tributaries. The confidence and stability of the Ming bureaucracy also created a sense of self-sufficiency, with little use for external influences.
Ocean-going vessels were made 
to report all the cargo they landed, and private maritime trade was periodically banned (until it was legalized again in 1567 for all except trade with Japan). In Beijing, a shopkeeper’s unauthorized contact with foreigners could result in the confiscation of his stock.Diplomatic isolation was reinforced by military uncertainty: Annam became independent once more in 1428, while huge resources were devoted to containing the threat posed by the Mongol tribes on China’s northern borders. In 1449, Emperor Zhengtong personally led a disastrous expedition against the Mongol leader Esen Khan in which the majority of the 500,000 Chinese soldiers died of hunger, were picked off by the enemy, or perished in a final battle as they retreated. 
Extending the Great Wall
In the 1470s, the building of the final stages of the Great Wall—begun by the Qin dynasty in the 3rd century 
bce—was not only a  
bid to prevent a similar disaster, but also to compensate for the Ming’s waning energy. Like their predecessors, they were unable to absorb the lands of the nomadic groups to the north of the border,  or to send out expeditions that had any lasting effect on discouraging their raids. Therefore, a fixed, strongly garrisoned border defense was the best compromise.

consorts, mothers, or by eunuch 
(castrated) advisers, was capped by the long reign of Wanli (1573–1620), who simply withdrew from public life entirely: for the last decades of his reign, he refused even to meet with his ministers. The dynasty began to decline: the machinery of government faltered and the army had little strength to respond to the serious threat posed by the Jurchen in Manchuria (now in northeast China). In 1619, this tribal people, who later renamed themselves Manchu, began to encroach on China’s northern borders.
Global trade
Economically, however, Ming China’s great productivity was  a magnet for European maritime states seeking new commercial connections in East Asia, and in the early 16th century, European traders finally reached the coast of China. In 1514, a Portuguese fleet 
US_120-127_Hongwu_founds_Ming.indd   126 15/02/2016   16:41127
appeared off Canton (now Guangzhou) in the south, and by 1557, Portugal had established a permanent base at Macao. Spanish and Portuguese merchants (the former operating from Nagasaki  in Japan and Manila in the Philippines)—and from 1601, the Dutch—secured an important share in trade with China.
Even though Ming policy 
discouraged foreign maritime trade, individual Chinese merchants had participated actively in the revived economy. Before long there were flourishing Chinese colonies in Manila and on Java in Indonesia, near the Dutch-controlled trading city of Batavia, and Chinese merchants controlled a large share of local trade in Southeast Asia. The technical sophistication of the Chinese porcelain industry under the Ming led for the first time to the mass production of ceramics for export to European markets.
The effects, though, of this 
growth in trade were not wholly positive: while a huge influx of silver from the Americas and Japan, used by the Europeans to pay for Chinese goods such as  silk, lacquerware, and porcelain, stimulated economic growth, it  also caused inflation.
Technological change
Ming China had inherited a legacy of scientific and technological innovation from the Song dynasty, which had left the country at the forefront of many scientific fields, including navigation and the military applications of gunpowder— a substance discovered during the Tang era whose use had spread  
to Europe from China in the 13th century. Under the Ming, though,  
the pace of progress slowed and by the later part of the dynasty, ideas had begun to flow in from Europe. The Chinese military began to use artillery of European manufacture, and knowledge of European mathematics and astronomy was introduced to the country through Jesuit missionaries, including Matteo Ricci, who lived in Beijing from 1601 to 1610. He translated  the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid’s Geometry  into Chinese, as 
well as a treatise on the astrolabe (an astronomical instrument used for taking the altitude of the sun or stars). In 1626, the German Jesuit Johann Adam Schall von Bell wrote the first treatise in Chinese on the telescope, bringing Heliocentrism (an astronomical model in which  
the sun lies at the center of the universe) to a Chinese audience.
The Ming collapse
The late Ming began to suffer many of the same issues that had led to the fall of the Yuan. Crop failures reduced the productivity of China’s vast agriculture, and famines and floods led to widespread unrest in rural areas. The army’s pay began to fall into arrears, leading to discipline problems and desertions, while localized peasant uprisings THE MEDIEVAL WORLD
coalesced into more general revolts.  Meanwhile, on the northeastern frontier, the Manchus had built  a state along Chinese lines at Mukden in Manchuria—calling their regime the Qing dynasty in 1636—and were now poised to take advantage of the Ming’s imminent collapse. They were aided in this by a revolt led by Li Zicheng, a rebel leader whose forces entered Beijing in 1644 unopposed, prompting the emperor to commit suicide. In desperation, the Ming military called on the Manchus for help. The tribesmen swept into the capital and drove out the rebels, but then seized the throne, and proclaimed the Qing dynasty in China. 
An enduring legacy
Although the Ming had fallen victim to an agrarian crisis that coincided with renewed nomadic activity on its frontiers, this was  a combination that had also brought down dynasties before it. The bureaucracy that had given China centuries of constancy and reduced the possibility, or even the need, for internal dissent, was slow to adapt itself to times of fast-moving crisis. 
Yet even so, the Ming era had 
brought great wealth and success to China. The population expanded from around 60 million at the start of its rule, to around three times  that number by 1600. Much of this growth was centered in medium-sized market towns, rather than  in large cities, and an increase in agricultural production led to the rise of an affluent merchant class in the provinces. Many of the elements of orderly government that Hongwu had inaugurated were carried over into the succeeding Qing dynasty, providing China with a degree of unity, stability, and prosperity that the European states of that period could only envy and admire.

Crop failures reduced the productivity of China’s vast agriculture, and famines and floods led to widespread unrest in rural areas. The army’s pay began to fall into arrears, leading to discipline problems and desertions, while localized peasant uprisings THE MEDIEVAL WORLD
coalesced into more general revolts.  Meanwhile, on the northeastern frontier, the Manchus had built  a state along Chinese lines at Mukden in Manchuria—calling their regime the Qing dynasty in 1636—and were now poised to take advantage of the Ming’s imminent collapse. They were aided in this by a revolt led by Li Zicheng, a rebel leader whose forces entered Beijing in 1644 unopposed, prompting the emperor to commit suicide. In desperation, the Ming military called on the Manchus for help. The tribesmen swept into the capital and drove out the rebels, but then seized the throne, and proclaimed the Qing dynasty in China. 
An enduring legacy
Although the Ming had fallen victim to an agrarian crisis that coincided with renewed nomadic activity on its frontiers, this was  a combination that had also brought down dynasties before it. The bureaucracy that had given China centuries of constancy and reduced the possibility, or even the need, for internal dissent, was slow to adapt itself to times of fast-moving crisis. 
Yet even so, the Ming era had 
brought great wealth and success to China. The population expanded from around 60 million at the start of its rule, to around three times  that number by 1600. Much of this growth was centered in medium-sized market towns, rather than  in large cities, and an increase in agricultural production led to the rise of an affluent merchant class in the provinces. Many of the elements of orderly government that Hongwu had inaugurated were carried over into the succeeding Qing dynasty, providing China with a degree of unity, stability, and prosperity that the European states of that period could only envy and admire.

CAST DOWN THE 
ADVERSARIES OF MY 
CHRISTIAN PEOPLE
 THE FALL OF GRANADA (1492)
At midnight on January 2, 
1492, Abu ‘Abd Allah, the Muslim Emir of Granada, 
handed over the keys of his city to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, joint rulers of the Christian Spanish states of Aragón and Castile. This act marked the end of nearly 800 years of Muslim rule in the Iberian peninsula and the eclipse of a  great civilization renowned for its architectural splendors and a rich tradition of scholarship. At the same time, it signaled the birth of a self-confident, united Spain that would soon divert its energies away from crusading against its Muslim neighbors, turning them instead towards building an overseas empire in the New World. 
Christian conquests
Muslim Spain (or al-Andalus)  dated from the Islamic conquest  of the Visigothic kingdom in 711. Christian resistance survived in Asturias, in the far north, but it  took centuries for the kingdoms of Castile, Aragón, León, and Navarre to gain the strength to push slowly southward into Muslim lands.  This gradual reconquest, known  as the Reconquista, gathered pace during the 11th century, when  the Muslim regions broke up into numerous competing emirates (“taifas ”) and lost the strategically 
important city of Toledo in central Spain, in 1085. 
The growth of the crusading 
spirit in western Europe also accelerated the progress of the Reconquista. Formal crusades against the Spanish Muslims (or Moors) were declared several times from the mid-14th century and a military culture emerged, in which raids into al-Andalus acquired the air of righteous expeditions.

 KING SEJONG INTRODUCES A NEW SCRIPT (1443)
In 1443, the Korean court of 
King Sejong announced the creation of Han’gul, a national 
alphabet for the Korean language, and launched a program of publications in the new script. The measure was one of a number of strategies encouraged by Korea’s king that were designed to stabilize Korea and improve prosperity, and enabled his Choson (or Yi) dynasty to survive for another 450 years.
Rise of the Yi dynasty
The Mongol Yuan dynasty had controlled the Korean Peninsula from the late 11th century until 1368, when it was overthrown by the Ming dynasty. Korea was left  in chaos as its Koryo kings tried  to reverse the effects of a century’s authoritarian domination. The redistribution of land and the sacking of pro-Mongol ministers led almost to civil war, but in 1392 Sejong’s grandfather Yi Songyye, a former general, stepped in, deposed the last Koryo king, and assumed the throne as King T’aejo. 
King T’aejo’s immediate priority 
was to secure stability, and the installation of a state ideology based on neo-Confucianism was key to achieving that. This ideology sought to re-establish proper relations between the ruler and his people, and conferred privileged status on a bureaucratic class that would act as guardian of the social hierarchy. Buddhism had been the dominant ideology under the Koryo dynasty, but T’aejo undermined its hold in the region by breaking up large estates controlled by Buddhist temples and redistributing the land, some to Confucian shrines. 
King Sejong of Choson , also known 
as Sejong the Great, revolutionized 
government by making it possible for people other than the social elite to become civil servants. IN CONTEXT

Neo-Confucianism emphasised  
the importance of education as a way of producing a class of literati capable of ensuring the harmonious running of the state. T’aejo's grandson, King Sejong (reigned 1418–1450) raised this principle to new heights, founding in 1420 the Chiphyon-jon (Hall of Worthies), an elite group of 20 scholars tasked with research that would promote the better running of the kingdom.
Encouragement of wider literacy 
was an important neo-Confucian ideal, and T’aejo had already ordered the foundation of government-sponsored schools. At the time, however, Korean was written in Chinese characters, which were  not well adapted to express the sounds of the language. Sejong himself is said to have developed the simplified script, the Han’gul, whose principles were explained  in Proper Sounds for the Education of the People , a book published in 
1445. Having only 28 characters—later reduced to 24—the script  was far easier than Chinese was  to learn, but its introduction faced bitter resistance from traditionalist nobles. They feared it might open civil service examinations to people from other social classes, which would risk diluting their power. As  a result Han’gul faded from use, relegated as the “vulgar letters”  of the lower orders, until its rediscovery in the 19th century, since when it has thrived as a vehicle for Korean nationalism.
The reforms of T’aejo and 
Sejong, however, broadly survived, creating a class of yangban—elite government officials dedicated to the perpetuation of the state. The yangban also acted as a break on any tendency to autocracy among the Yi monarchs, which helped  the resulting dynasty to endure for more than five centuries.

The neo-Confucianism that

A more rationalist and secular form of Confucianism, the new philosophy rejected superstitious and mystical elements that had influenced Confucianism during and after the Han dynasty. Writers such as Confucian scholar Zhu Xi stressed the importance of morality, respect for social harmony, and education as means of understanding the Supreme Ultimate (
tai qi ), the 
underlying principle of the universe. In practice, however, neo-Confucian virtues such  
as loyalty, determination, and the belief that a supreme monarch should rule the state  
to parallel the Supreme Ultimate that governed the universe, tended to favor a hierarchical, bureaucratic state staffed  
by scholars who jealously maintained the status quo.

THE ARAB ADVANCE IS 
HALTED AT TOURS 
(732)
By the 8th century, the Islamic 
people of the Arabian peninsula had conquered much of North Africa and crossed into Europe, occupying Spain and moving into southern France. Their northward expansion seemed unstoppable—until 732, when they met combined Frankish and Burgundian troops at Tours. The Franks and Burgundians won the battle, and the Arab leader, Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi, was killed. Although there was another invasion in 735–39, the Arabs  never got further than Tours.  The Franks kept their power in Western Europe, Christianity was preserved as the continent’s dominant faith, and only Spain remained under Muslim rule.
ALFRED RULES WESSEX
(871–99)
Alfred was an able ruler and military leader who successfully defended his kingdom from Danish invaders. He expanded his territory from his base in Wessex (central southern England), uniting a large part of southern England under him. He built fortifications, founded a navy, encouraged education, and promoted Old English as a literary language via translations of Latin books. Alfred became known as “King of the English” and, although the Danes still held the northeast, is seen as the monarch who first his rule into northern Italy, creating what became the Holy Roman Empire. This major political power—whose emperors claimed to be the secular leaders of Christian Europe, vying with the Popes for power—dominated much of Europe for more than 900 years.
THE GREAT SCHISM
(1054)
During the late centuries of the  1st millennium 
ce, the Eastern  
and Western parts of the Christian church had several disagreements about authority (with the pope claiming seniority over the Eastern patriarchs, but the latter disputing this), the wording of the Creed,  and liturgical matters. These disputes came to a head in 1054, when Pope Leo IX and Patriarch Michael I excommunicated one another, creating a split called  the Great Schism. This division between what are now the  
Catholic and Orthodox churches has never been healed.
THE NORMAN CONQUEST 
OF ENGLAND
(1066)
In 1066, the English king Edward 
the Confessor died childless, and  a dispute arose over who should succeed him. One of the claimants to the throne was Duke William of Normandy, who invaded England, defeated the English at the Battle  of Hastings, and was crowned king. This event forged a long-standing FURTHER EVENTS

THE SPREAD OF THE 
MISSISSIPPI CULTURE
(c.900)
There was a long tradition, lasting 
several millennia, of native North American groups based around large earth mounds that had been built for use in rituals or to house  the dwellings of the ruling class. These communities were mostly confined to local areas, from Ohio to Mississippi, but the Mississippi culture spread widely through eastern North America. They  grew maize intensively, worked copper, and developed hierarchical societies. Recognition of this complex culture has been a key element in debunking the idea that American Indian peoples were primitive and in forming a clearer understanding of their civilization.
OTTO I BECOMES  
HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR
(962)
German ruler Otto I suppressed revolts, united the Germanic tribes, and defeated outside aggressors such as the Magyars. In addition, he changed the relationship between the ruler and the Catholic church by exercising tight control over the clergy and using his close links to the church to increase  royal power. He also extended

THE HUNDRED YEARS’ WAR
(1337–1453)
The Hundred Years’ War was a series of conflicts fought between England and France that began when Edward III asserted his  right to the French throne, a claim that the French Valois dynasty disputed. By the end of the war, English possessions in France  had been reduced to the coastal town of Calais and its immediate environs. This result transformed England from a power that aspired to be part of a larger European empire to an island nation separate from Europe. France, inspired especially by the leadership of  Joan of Arc, gained a stronger sense of national identity.
THE BATTLE OF GRUNWALD
(1410)
At the Battle of Grunwald, a combined Polish and Lithuanian force crushed the army of the Teutonic Knights. This military order, set up to assist crusaders and pilgrims, controlled large territories in Eastern Europe, including Prussia and Estonia,  and campaigned against Slavs  and pagans in the Baltic. This decisive battle put an end to the Knights’ military power, arrested German eastward expansion,  and left the Polish–Lithuanian alliance as the strongest power  in Eastern Europe.  
THE MONGOL INVASIONS 
OF JAPAN ARE REPULSED
(1274, 1281)
In the late 13th century, the 
Mongols were at the height of their power under their leader Kublai Khan. From their base in central Asia, they had moved east to take control of China. In 1271, they sent troops by sea to conquer Japan. The attack was unsuccessful, in part because the Mongol ships were caught in a typhoon, referred to by the Japanese as a kamikaze  
(divine wind). The Mongol defeat was decisive in checking their advance and shaping the idea  of a strong, independent Japan,  free from outside intervention or influence. This concept of Japanese nationhood lasted for centuries.
SCOTLAND UPHOLDS 
INDEPENDENCE AT BANNOCKBURN
(1314)
The Battle of Bannockburn, 
Scotland, was a major clash in an ongoing war between England and Scotland. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Scots, under King Robert Bruce, inflicted a heavy defeat on the English and their ruler Edward II. This left Bruce in full control of Scotland, from where he continued to lead raids on northern England. The war went on for decades, and Scotland remained independent until 1707. The battle was such a sweeping victory that it is still remembered as a key event in Scottish history, symbolizing the independence  from the rest of Britain to which many Scots still aspire. 
THE CONQUESTS OF 
TAMERLANE
(1370–1405)
Timur, also known as Tamerlane, 
was the last of the great nomadic Mongol conquerors. In an attempt to revive the great empire of Kublai Khan, he roamed widely across Europe and Asia, from northern India to Anatolia and Russia. By the end of the 14th century, he  had conquered Persia, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and eastern Russia, destroying Delhi in 1398, and pushing on toward China in 1405 but dying en route. His empire did not endure, and Mongol horse-based fighting techniques were no match for the firearms that increasingly drove warfare in the 15th century.
THE HUSSITE REVOLT
(1415–34)
The Hussites, followers of the religious reformer Jan Hus, were precursors of the Protestants who lived in Bohemia (modern Czech Republic, then part of the Austrian Habsburg empire) and fought their Catholic rulers for the freedom to worship in their own way. Hus  was executed for heresy in 1415, sparking a series of wars that eventually led to the defeat of the Hussites. The area remained under Catholic Hapsburg rule, but most  of the people of Bohemia stayed true to their Protestant beliefs. Their revolt against their Catholic rulers in 1618 triggered the Thirty Years’ War, when the Bohemian Protestants were again defeated.

Their revolt against their Catholic rulers in 1618 triggered the Thirty Years’ War, when the Bohemian Protestants were again defeated.

The course of world events 
always looks different in retrospect from the way 
that it appears at the time, but the contrast in perspective is rarely as extreme as in the Early Modern Era, which spanned the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. Today, this period  is often viewed as the age during which Europe climbed toward world domination, but to Europeans living at the time it often seemed to be full of unprecedented disasters. The unity of Christendom was split by the Reformation, and sectarian conflict between Catholics and Protestants, combined with power struggles between competing royal dynasties, made Europe a place of frequent warfare—a continent tearing itself apart. Meanwhile,  the Muslim armies of the Ottoman Empire threatened the heartland  of Europe, seizing the Byzantine city of Constantinople and twice penetrating as far as Vienna. 
Yet historical retrospect certainly 
recognizes changes underway that were to make European nations the founders of the modern world. The flowering of arts and ideas in the Renaissance meant that Europe ceased to be a cultural backwater. Printing and paper, both originally invented in China, were used by Europeans to create mass-produced books that went on to revolutionize the dissemination of information. Gunpowder weapons, also invented by the Chinese, were deployed most effectively by European armies and navies. Above all, explorers and sailors from Europe’s western sea-board established oceanic trade routes that laid the foundations for the first global economy. 
The start of colonialism
The importance of Christopher Columbus’s transatlantic voyage  in 1492 cannot be exaggerated.  It established a permanent link between two entire ecosystems that had evolved in isolation from each another for almost 10,000 years. The initial impact on the inhabitants of the Americas was catastrophic. Eurasian diseases and the infamous brutality of the Spanish conquistadors decimated the population. A remarkably small number of European invaders conquered the most sophisticated American states with startling ease, laying potentially the entire New World open to European exploitation and colonization. 
However, the arrival of European 
sailors in Asia did not have the same dramatic impact. Powerful INTRODUCTION

Economic growth
From the second half of the 17th century, signs of economic growth  accelerated in Europe. Productivity of labor in trades and agriculture increased notably in areas like the Dutch Netherlands. New financial institutions, such as central banks and joint stock companies, laid the foundations of modern capitalism. Complex patterns of maritime trade linked European colonies in the Americas to Europe, Africa, and Asia. Slaves, mostly bought by European traders in West Africa, were transported in vast numbers to work on colonial plantations, so that in some parts of the New World people of African descent greatly outnumbered both Europeans and the native population. At home, Europeans consumed luxury goods from China and India, and products such as sugar and coffee from plantations in the Caribbean and Brazil. North America, the West Indies, and India were all regions of colonial contention—the precipitous decline of the Mughal Empire having opened up parts of India  to European territorial conquest.
Intellectual movements
Even at this stage, the degree of European ascendancy should not be exaggerated. China had gone through difficult times in the mid-17th century transition from the Ming to the Qing dynasty, but in  the 18th century, imperial China was enjoying a golden age of power and prosperity. The population of Europe had begun a steep increase to unprecedented levels—a result  of improved food production and declining epidemic diseases—

In 1453, the Ottoman Turks 
attacked and took the city of Constantinople, the capital  
of the Byzantine Empire. The loss  of this millennium-old Christian empire, which had once stretched virtually all the way around the Mediterranean, was a profound shock to the Christian world. As  if to symbolize the Muslim victorySancta Sophia, one of the greatest cathedrals in Christendom, was converted into a mosque.
The Ottoman Turks had already 
conquered much of the surrounding territory before Sultan Mehmet II (1432–1481) laid siege to the city and bombarded it with heavy artillery. Having breached its walls, his army of more than 80,000 men then overwhelmed the small force IN CONTEXT

A weakening empire
The Byzantine Empire was already in terminal decline by the time Constantinople was taken. It had shrunk to include only the capital city, some land to its west, and the southern part of Greece. The decline began at the Battle of Manzikert (1071), during which  
the army of the Turkish Seljuk dynasty drove the Byzantines out  of their crucial territory in Anatolia. From this point, rival claims for the Byzantine crown, disputes over  tax, loss of trade revenue, and poor military leadership all contributed to the contraction of the empire.
In 1203, the Fourth Crusade— 
a western European expedition originally intended to conquer Jerusalem—became entangled in the empire’s politics. Some of the crusade leaders pledged to help restore the deposed Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos in return for support for their expedition. They were initially successful: Angelos’ son was crowned as co- emperor but, in 1204, he in turn was deposed by a popular uprising. The Byzantine senate elected a young noble, Nicolas Canabus, as emperor, and he refused to back the crusaders. Denied their promised payments, the crusaders and their allies, the Venetians, responded with a ruthless attack on the city. They raped and killed civilians, looted churches, and demolished priceless works of art. Constantinople was all but destroyed.

Before capturing Constantinople, the Ottoman Empire had already expanded from Anatolia into the Balkans.

ruled by him directly, and acted  
as buffer zones between Muslim and Christian areas. Some vassal states, including Bulgaria, Serbia, and Bosnia, were eventually absorbed into the larger empire; others retained their vassal status.
Government and military 
The Ottomans evolved a strong system of government that combined local administration  with central control. The sultan—whose brothers were customarily murdered at his accession—was supreme ruler. He had a council of advisers, later a deputy, who ruled on his behalf. Local areas were ruled by military governors (beys) under the emperor’s overall control, but local councils kept the beys’ authority in check. 
Non-Muslim communities 
within the empire were allowed a degree of self-rule through a system of separate courts called millets. The millets allowed Armenian, Jewish, and Orthodox Christian communities to rule according to their own laws in cases that did not involve Muslims. This balanced combination of central and local control enabled the Ottomans to THE FALL OF CONSTANTINOPLE

hold together a large and diverse 
empire for much longer than would have been possible with a more wholly centralized system.
Mehmet II Mehmet (1432–1481), the son of 
the Ottoman emperor Murad II, was born in Edirne, Turkey. As was usual for an heir to the Ottoman throne, Mehmet had an Islamic education, and at 11 years old was appointed governor of a province, Amasya, to gain experience of leadership. A year later, Murad abdicated in favor of his son, but shortly afterward was called back from his retirement in Anatolia to lend military support. “If you are the Sultan,” Mehmet wrote, “come and lead your armies. If I am the Sultan, I order you to come and lead my armies.” Mehmet’s second, main, rule was from 1451 to 1481. His victory at Constantinople was followed by a string of further conquests: the Morea (southern Greece), Serbia, the coast of the Black Sea, Wallachia, Bosnia, and part of the Crimea. He rebuilt Constantinople as his capital and founded mosques there, while also allowing Christians and Jews to worship freely. Known for his ruthless military leadership, he also welcomed humanists to the capital, encouraged culture,  
and founded a university.The Ottoman army was also  
crucial to the empire’s success.  It was technically advanced—employing cannon from the siege  of Constantinople onward—and tactically sophisticated. Its high-speed cavalry units could turn what looked like a retreat into a devastatingly effective flanking attack, surrounding the enemy in  a crescent-shaped formation that would take them by surprise. 
At the heart of the army were 
the Janissaries, a unit of infantry that began as the imperial guard and expanded to become the most feared elite force of the period. Initially, the unit was made up of men who, as children, had been abducted from Christian families  in the Balkans. Under the devsirme  
system, which was also known as the “blood tax” or “tribute in blood,” boys aged from eight to 18 were taken by Ottoman military, forcibly converted to Islam, and sent to live with Turkish families, where they learned the Turkish language and customs. They were then given rigorous military training, and  any who showed particular talent  were selected for specialized roles ranging from archers to engineers.

continued to explore the Caribbean, 
visiting Cuba, Hispaniola, and several of the smaller islands.  
He met with a mostly peaceful response from the native people, whom he observed might make good servants or slaves. He also noticed their gold jewelry, and  
took a sample of local gold, as  
well as some native prisoners,  
back to Europe. 
Columbus was to return to the 
Caribbean on three later voyages, bringing in his wake countless European visitors and settlers. 
Motivation to explore
The rulers and merchants of Western Europe wanted to explore the Atlantic for primarily economic reasons. Spices that would not grow in Europe’s climate, such as cinnamon, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, and pepper, were prized not only  for their taste but also because they could help to preserve foods. There was also an enthusiastic market  
for luxury goods such as silk and precious stones, commodities that came primarily from the islands of the Indonesian group, such as the Moluccas, which were known in Europe as the Spice Islands.  
Bringing such commodities 
across Asia by land was difficult and dangerous because of local wars and instabilities along the route; it was also costly, since during their journey goods would pass through many different merchants’ hands. There were certainly excellent economic reasons to develop sea routes: anyone who could find a more direct way of importing these goods to Western Europe would become very rich.

Columbus became a business agent for several prominent Genoese families and undertook trading voyages in Europe and along the African coast. 
Columbus followed his voyage 
to America with a second in 1493, during which he explored the Lesser and Greater Antilles, and set up a colony at La Isabela in what is now the Dominican Republic. His third voyage (1498–1500) took him to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola and on to Trinidad, where he found the coast of South America and guessed, from the size of the Orinoco River, that he had found a huge land mass. During this time, settlers complained to the Crown about the way he ran his Caribbean colony, and he was dismissed as governor. 
On his last voyage (1502–04) 
he sailed along the Central American coast, hoping to find  
a strait to the Indian Ocean. He returned to Spain in poor health and an increasingly disturbed state of mind, feeling he had not received the recognition and benefits he had been promised. Columbus died in 1506. Another reason why Europeans 
started to explore sea routes in the late Middle Ages was to investigate the possibility of establishing European colonies in Asia. These could act not only as trading posts, but also as bases for missionaries, who could convert the locals to Christianity. This they believed would help to reduce the perceived threat of Islam. 
By the 14th and 15th centuries, 
the Spanish, Portuguese, English, and Dutch had developed ocean-going ships, and trained sailors who could navigate over long distances. Explorers used various types of vessels, among the most successful of which was the caravel—a fast, lightweight, and extremely maneuverable ship that was usually equipped with a mix of square and lateen (triangular) sails. The lateen sails made it possible to sail to windward (into the wind), which allowed explorers to make progress even in variable wind conditions. Explorers also used the carrack, or nau, a larger vessel that was similarly rigged. On his first transatlantic voyage, Columbus  
took two caravels, each probably  
of 50–70 tons, and one carrack of about 100 tons, the extra capacity being useful for carrying stores.

way. Subsequent rulers continued  
to sponsor voyages and, in 1488, 
Portuguese captain Bartolomeu Dias rounded the southern tip of Africa. Soon another Portuguese navigator, Vasco da Gama, led the push to round the Cape and pressed on across the Indian Ocean, linking Europe and Asia for the first time  
by ocean route.
Since Portugal dominated the 
sea route along the African coast, Portugal’s European neighbor  
and rival Spain needed to find an alternative route, if it was to gain access to the riches of the East. Although educated people knew  
by this time that the Earth was round, they did not know about  
the existence of the Americas. An alternative way to the East seemed, therefore, to be to sail west across the Atlantic. This route seemed especially attractive to the many seamen—including Christopher Columbus—who believed the planet’s diameter to be rather smaller than it actually is. 
Seeking sponsorship
In 1485, Columbus presented to John II, king of Portugal, a plan to sail across the Atlantic to the Spice Islands. John refused to invest in  
the scheme, however. This was partly because Portugal was already exploring the West African coast with some success, and partly because the experts John consulted about the proposal were skeptical about the distances involved. 
Columbus cast his net more 
widely, seeking backing from the powerful maritime cities of Genoa and Venice, and sending his brother to England to do the same—but still he received no encouragement. He therefore turned to Ferdinand of CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS REACHES AMERICA
Aragon and Isabella of Castile, the “Catholic Monarchs” who jointly ruled Spain. At first they turned him down, their navigational consultants also skeptical about the length of his proposed route, but eventually, Such inhumanities and 
Barbarisms were committed... 
acts so foreign to human 
nature that I now tremble  
as I write.

 Spanish historian (c.1527)
Columbus’s voyage  was a bold undertaking. 
Despite a general understanding that the world 
was spherical, many believed the westward journey was doomed to fail, fearing the crew would die of thirst before ever reaching land.
On August 3rd, 
1492,  Columbus 
departed Spain with three ships: the Niña, Pinta, and Santa Maria.The voyage to America and back lasted seven months, from August 3rd, 1492—March 15th 1493.Provisions on  board  
the ships included vinegar, olive oil, wine, 
salted flour, biscuits,  
dry legumes, and  salted sardines.
The crew  consisted of  
87 men—20 on the Niña, 26 on the Pinta, and 41  on the Santa Maria.StartFinish
Columbus calculated that Asia was 2,400 miles away from Spain. In fact it is around 12,200 miles away. On October 12th,  1492,  the ships  
finally reached  the Bahamas.

after protracted negotiations, they 
agreed to sponsor the voyage. Securing a new trade route would certainly bring material rewards, but Isabella also saw the voyage in terms of a religious mission that could bring the light of Christianity to the East.
Columbus sails west
Having been granted viceroyship and governorship of any lands he could claim for Spain, plus other benefits including 10 percent of any revenues they yielded, Columbus set sail westward in 1492. He called at Gran Canaria before sailing west, sighting land five weeks later. In early 1493 he returned to Europe with two ships, the third having been wrecked off the coast of present-day Haiti, and was duly appointed Governor of the Indies.
Columbus’s second expedition 
was organized just a few months later. This involved 17 ships loaded with some 1,200 people who would found Spanish colonies in the Caribbean. As well as farmers and soldiers, the colonists included THE EARLY MODERN ERA

Columbus’s achievement in  
1492 is often described as the European “discovery” of America.

However, the Viking settlement was not  long-lived, and was unknown to Columbus and his contemporaries. 
Nevertheless, Columbus’s 1492

 THE TREATY OF TORDESILLAS ( 1494  )
Spain and Portugal signed a 
treaty on June 7, 1494, at Tordesillas in Spain, that 
resolved the countries’ disputes about the possession of newly discovered territory. The rulers settled on a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands as a line of demarcation. All the lands to the west of this line would belong to Spain; all those to the east would belong to Portugal. The line was chosen because of its location:  
it lies roughly halfway between  
the Cape Verde Islands, which already belonged to Portugal,  
and the Caribbean islands,  
which Christopher Columbus  
had claimed for Spain in 1492. IN CONTEXT

By the 1490s both countries were 
discovering substantial territories, including lands in the New World, although at this point the size and extent of the Americas was unclear to Europeans. In spite of the fact that the Spanish Crown had funded Columbus’s voyages, Spain’s claim to his discoveries was not clear-cut. The 1479 Alcaçovas treaty between the Catholic Monarchs of Spain  and the rulers of Portugal gave all newly discovered lands south of the Canary Islands to Portugal. When Columbus landed at Lisbon after his first voyage, he told John II, king of Portugal, that he was claiming Hispaniola and Cuba for his Spanish backers. John wrote to Spain’s rulers immediately to say that he was preparing to send his own ships to claim the Caribbean for Portugal. 
Legalizing possession
To prevent such disputes erupting each time a navigator made a  fresh discovery, the leaders of both countries decided to review the terms of the Alcaçovas treaty.  The papacy had been involved  in the 1479 treaty, and now Pope Alexander VI (a Spaniard) proposed a combined north–south and east–west dividing line, suggesting that any lands west and south of a line 100 leagues west and south of the Azores and Cape Verde Islands be allocated to Spain. John rejected the proposition, considering it to be biased in favor of his rivals, and eventually all parties agreed on the meridian between the Cape Verde Islands and the Caribbean.

By the time the Tordesillas treaty was signed, Portugal had already made headway in exploring Africa and southern Asia. Working south from a North African base at Ceuta, explorers established a series of trading posts on the West African coast, gradually pushing south until, in 1498, Vasco da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope and sailed into the Indian Ocean. In the 16th century, Portugal had settlements in India, the Moluccas, Sumatra, Burma, and Thailand, and by 1557 they had established their long-standing enclave in Macau, which became a hub for their trade with many Asian communities.

the colonists, and as a result of  
their ruthless treatment, and slaves 
were brought in from Africa to replace them. Brazil, ruled from the mid-16th century by Portuguese governors-general, remained a colony until the early 19th century. 
The Spanish in America
Following Columbus’s transatlantic voyages and the settlement of the treaty, Spain turned increasingly to America, sponsoring expeditions that combined exploration with conquest and colonization. The first of these, led by Hernán Cortés, was to Mexico, which was then home to the small but rich Aztec Empire. The empire’s large, central capital was at Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City). With just a small force of about 600 men, Cortés overthrew the million-strong empire, eventually killing its ruler, Moctezuma. Another Spanish leader, Francisco Pizarro, conquered the Inca Empire, which centered on Peru but also included Chile, Ecuador, and large parts of Bolivia and northwestern Argentina. Again with just a small force (180 men), Pizarro laid the foundations of another Spanish stronghold and source of great wealth in precious metals. Peruvian silver became the main source of Spain’s income from its colonies.
Several factors contributed to 
Cortés’ and Pizarro’s astounding conquests. The Aztecs were overwhelmed by a kind of battle THE TREATY OF TORDESILLAS
unknown to them, involving firearms and the single-minded slaughter of opponents—Aztec practice was to capture prisoners, whom they would later kill in ritual sacrifice. The Spanish were also helped by alliances they made  with local peoples who were hostile to the Aztecs. The result for Spain was a flow of wealth across the Atlantic and a secure base for building on their involvement in  the Americas.
Further Spanish colonization 
followed, including that of Colombia, known to the Spanish as New Granada. By the end of the 17th century, much of western and central South America was  
in Spanish hands. Conquered areas, and the people who lived in them, were parceled out to the Spanish conquistadors, who 
The siege of Tenochtitlan , the  
Aztec capital, was decisive in the 
Spanish conquest of Mexico, and brought the Spaniards a step closer to their goal of colonizing the Americas.

undertook to convert the locals  
to Christianity. They did convert 
them, but they also made them perform forced labor, especially in the silver mines. Laborers fell victim to disease and exploitation—like their counterparts in Brazil, but on  
a lesser scale—and slaves from Africa were brought in to supplement their numbers. 
The Spanish Crown tried to 
control this large empire, appointing viceroys to rule over the settlers and the native American peoples, and taking a fifth of the profits from silver mining. Settlers increasingly resisted this external interference, however, and by the 19th century the empire was diminishing as areas from Colombia to Chile won their independence. 
Circumnavigation
The Treaty of Tordesillas set the  seal of approval on Spain’s activity in America, but this deterred neither Spain nor Portugal from looking for a westward route to eastern Asia,  a potential source of spices, luxury goods, and great wealth for traders from Europe. Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian navigator working for the Portuguese Crown, was one of the first to take this exploration further. He explored the coast of South America, and is remembered because America is named after him. The Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan was next to explore this route, this time on behalf of Spain. He believed that the Spice Islands could be less than halfway around the world when sailing west from the treaty line, which would give Spain a claim to them. In 1519 he set out with five ships in an ambitious attempt to make the first circumnavigation  
of the globe. Although Magellan himself died en route, some of the expedition survivors completed the voyage, giving Spain a basis for its claim to land in Southeast Asia. 
In 1529 the rival Crowns signed 
another treaty at Zaragoza. This agreement assigned the Philippines to Spain and the Moluccas to Portugal.
The treaty’s heritage
European countries not party to  the Tordesillas agreement simply ignored it, and soon began to move in to develop their own empires. Britain colonized North America, for example, the Dutch moved into the Spice Islands, and several European countries set up colonies in the Caribbean. The treaty did, however, influence a significant proportion of the world. It underlined a development that was already beginning in Europe in which wealth and influence were passing from the old central European powers (based in the Holy Roman Empire) to the coastal, maritime powers that looked to build empires in new territories. These empires brought both Spain and Portugal enormous riches, and their overseas empires left a significant cultural legacy: much of South and Central America is Spanish-speaking, and there is a major Portuguese heritage in parts of Africa and Asia, the greatest of all being in Brazil. 
■THE EARLY MODERN ERA
Ferdinand Magellan 
Born into a noble Portuguese 
family, Magellan (1480–1521) was orphaned as a boy, and sent to the Portuguese royal court to act as page. 
As a young man, he 
became a naval officer. He served in Portugal’s colonies in India and took part in the conquest of the Moluccas,  
but after a disagreement with the Portuguese king, he went to Spain to look for support  
for his venture westward. By  1518 he had the backing of  the Spanish king Charles I, and set off the following year with five ships. 
After losing one ship to  
the weather and another to a desertion, Magellan navigated the narrow sea route (named the Strait of Magellan in his honor) between what is now mainland South America and Tierra del Fuego. He emerged in an ocean he named Pacific, because of its calmness. He crossed this expanse of water, stopping at Guam, and then in the Philippines, where he was killed. Only one ship, under Juan Sebastien del Cano, made it back to Europe in 1522, having achieved the first circumnavigation of the globe.Those regions which  
we found and explored with  
the fleet… we may rightly  
call a New World.

In 1529 the rival Crowns signed 
another treaty at Zaragoza. This agreement assigned the Philippines to Spain and the Moluccas to Portugal.
The treaty’s heritage
European countries not party to  the Tordesillas agreement simply ignored it, and soon began to move in to develop their own empires. Britain colonized North America, for example, the Dutch moved into the Spice Islands, and several European countries set up colonies in the Caribbean. The treaty did, however, influence a significant proportion of the world. It underlined a development that was already beginning in Europe in which wealth and influence were passing from the old central European powers (based in the Holy Roman Empire) to the coastal, maritime powers that looked to build empires in new territories. These empires brought both Spain and Portugal enormous riches, and their overseas empires left a significant cultural legacy: much of South and Central America is Spanish-speaking, and there is a major Portuguese heritage in parts of Africa and Asia, the greatest of all being in Brazil. 
■THE EARLY MODERN ERA
Ferdinand Magellan 
Born into a noble Portuguese 
family, Magellan (1480–1521) was orphaned as a boy, and sent to the Portuguese royal court to act as page. 
As a young man, he 
became a naval officer. He served in Portugal’s colonies in India and took part in the conquest of the Moluccas,  
but after a disagreement with the Portuguese king, he went to Spain to look for support  
for his venture westward. By  1518 he had the backing of  the Spanish king Charles I, and set off the following year with five ships. 
After losing one ship to  
the weather and another to a desertion, Magellan navigated the narrow sea route (named the Strait of Magellan in his honor) between what is now mainland South America and Tierra del Fuego. He emerged in an ocean he named Pacific, because of its calmness. He crossed this expanse of water, stopping at Guam, and then in the Philippines, where he was killed. Only one ship, under Juan Sebastien del Cano, made it back to Europe in 1522, having achieved the first circumnavigation of the globe.Those regions which  
we found and explored with  
the fleet… we may rightly  
call a New World.

OF FLORENCE CATHEDRAL (1420)
In 1418, the wealthy Guild of 
Wool Merchants of Florence launched a competition to find 
a design for a dome to complete their unfinished cathedral—the Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore, commonly known as Il Duomo. The city of Florence was one of the richest in Italy, a center of banking and trade and it was on the basis  of this wealth that the city could afford to commission a cathedral dome of unprecedented size. 
This lavish spending on art and 
architecture would soon be echoed across Italy, as the region’s growing prosperity meant that rulers and rich citizens could spend money to beautify their towns and enhance IN CONTEXT

Il Duomo
At the time of the competition, Florence’s cathedral featured a  vast octagonal space toward its eastern end, but since work on the building began in 1296 no one had worked out how to make a dome to cover it. The dome would have to be the largest cupola constructed since the late Roman period and the guild specified that it should be built without external buttresses, favored by their political rivals in France, Germany, and Milan and also considered old-fashioned. This seemed an impossible task. The young goldsmith and clockmaker-turned- architect Filippo Brunelleschi won the competition with his daring plan for a huge eight-sided brick dome, but many doubted that he would be able to construct it. 
The main problem was being 
able to support the structure in such a way that it did not spread and collapse under its own weight. Brunelleschi’s ingenious solution was to construct two concentric domes—an inner supporting dome and a larger outer one. The domes were then joined together with huge brick arches and a complex interlocking system of “chains” made from rings of stone and wooden beams that were attached by iron clamps to prevent the dome from expanding outwards 
The result—which was finally 
completed in 1436—remains the largest masonry dome in the world. Combining the style of antiquity with new engineering techniques, it exhibited the blend of ancient wisdom and modern knowledge that typified the Renaissance. 
THE EARLY MODERN ERA
The Renaissance in Italy
Meaning “rebirth,” the Renaissance was a movement that started in Italy and began to spread across Europe from the mid-14th century.  Its roots lay in the rediscovery of the culture of ancient Greece and Rome and it influenced all the arts, as well as science and scholarship. Painters, sculptors, and architects broke free from the traditions of medieval art. They visited the monuments of ancient Rome, looking at classical statues and the carvings on Roman buildings, and created works of art in the classical style. This new movement inspired architects,  such as Leon Battista Alberti and Brunelleschi, and a wave of great artists, including Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Most of these figures were active in many fields—Brunelleschi was a sculptor and engineer as well as an architect; Michelangelo painted, sculpted, and wrote poetry; while da Vinci’s achievements spanned both the arts and the sciences.

led to the emergence of Renaissance Humanism in Italy, which involved studying the humanities—grammar, rhetoric, history, philosophy, and poetry—and, more broadly, a high regard for the dignity and potential of the human race.

powerful city-states—mainly 
Florence, Milan, Ferrara, and Venice—together with Rome,  from where the pope could exercise great secular (“temporal”) power  as well as being the spiritual head  of the Catholic Church. The city-states generated a lot of wealth from trade and—as in the case of Florence—banking. Their ruling families, such as the Gonzaga in Renaissance painters and sculptors sought to represent the physical world in a more realistic way than their Medieval predecessors: they valued anatomical accuracy and developed scientific methods of illustrating perspective. As in classical art, there was more focus on human beauty and the nude. 
There was also a revival of 
interest in classical learning, which was influenced by Greek scholars from the Byzantine Empire, who settled in Italy when Constantinople (the empire’s capital) fell in 1453. The émigrés  brought with them 
ancient Greek literary, historical, and philosophical texts, which had been lost to the West, and taught the Italians Greek so they could

Mantua, the d’Este in Ferrara, the 
Sforza in Milan, and the Medici in Florence, spent lavishly on palaces, churches, and works of art, and became patrons of many great Renaissance artists. These wealthy families also encouraged the revival of classical learning by employing scholars as tutors for their children. In addition, several members of the Medici family became popes.
Spread of the Renaissance
From the end of the 15th century, the Renaissance spread from Italy to other parts of Europe and a Northern Renaissance emerged. Northern countries, particularly  the Netherlands and Germany, produced their own great artists, such as Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) and Hans Holbein the Younger (1497–1543)—both gifted realists. Renaissance Humanism also spread northward, but northern writers and philosophers, most notably Erasmus of Rotterdam (1466–1536), tended to place more emphasis on Christianity, education, and reform than their Italian counterparts.
The invention of printing  
using movable type by Johannes Gutenberg in Germany in the  1430s enabled Renaissance ideas to spread even more quickly. Before Gutenberg, the only way printed text was possible was for each page to be carved by hand into a block of wood, but as this was so laborious books were invariably written out by hand. Gutenberg’s method involved arranging individual metal letters and punctuation symbols in lines and pages; when many copies of  a page had been printed, the type could be taken apart and reused. He combined this new idea with the existing technology of paper-making and the kind of press used in wine production, and the result was the printing of multiple copies of books for the first time. 
Gutenberg’s invention had a 
major impact. It meant that books, which had previously been costly and took months to produce, were now easily available and much more affordable, so ideas and information could circulate quickly and reach more people. While the church had used mostly Latin as  its universal language, writers now wrote in their local tongues, and as a result literature in French, English, German, and other languages flourished. In addition, copies of the ancient classics were reproduced  in quantity, thus helping to spread ideas that were central to both the Renaissance and Humanism.
The Renaissance’s impact
By the mid-16th century, the influence of the Renaissance was waning in southern Europe, but it lasted slightly longer in the north. However, many great Renaissance works endured and they continued to inspire future generations of painters and architects. Indeed, the longstanding popularity of oil paintings and classical style of architecture, and the rise of Humanism, would all have been impossible without the movement that began with Brunelleschi in Florence in the 15th century. 
■THE EARLY MODERN ERA
Filippo Brunelleschi
Born in Florence, Filippo 
Brunelleschi (1377–1446) was the son of a civil servant, who educated Filippo in the hope that he would follow in his footsteps. However, Filippo was artistically talented and instead trained as a goldsmith and a clockmaker before becoming an architect. When he was around 25, he traveled to Rome with his friend, the sculptor Donatello, where he studied the remains of ancient Roman buildings and read the treatise On Architecture  by 
the Roman writer Vitruvius.  
In 1419, he won his first major commission—the design of an orphanage, the Ospedale degli Innocenti in Florence, which, with its arched loggia, is one of the first great Renaissance buildings. A number of other fine works, including chapels in Florentine churches and fortifications for the city, cemented his reputation, but the stunning dome of Il Duomo is his masterpiece. In addition to his buildings, Brunelleschi did important work on the theory of linear perspective, and designed machinery to produce special effects in theatrical productions.

The Battle of Castillon was the climax of the Hundred Years’ War, fought since 1337 by England and France, countries that had long been closely linked by their ruling families. By the time of Castillon, great changes had taken place in the fabric of European life, which profoundly altered the armies with which the French and English monarchs fought.
The Europe of the 15th century 
was principally a money economy, and everyone, including soldiers, expected to be paid. Kings were thus increasingly reliant on mercenaries who fought for pay. This was a sharp contrast to the feudal system that had existed previously, in which fighting men were provided by the nobility in exchange for land.   Eventually, rulers began employing mercenaries on a permanent basis: a standing army. But it wasn’t until the later 17th century that this model became the norm.
Cannons and guns
The kings who fought for control of France relied increasingly on large armies and expensive artillery.  Cannons, like those that secured  the French victory at Castillon, transformed warfare. The stout walls of medieval castles provided little defense against a cannonball.To better resist artillery rulers began, from the 16th century, to build a new type of fortification, the star fort. These forts had walls sunk into ditches to strengthen them against direct fire and also used cannons themselves in an active defense. 
At the same time, hand firearms 
that fired projectiles that smashed through the armor of mounted knights and required little skill to wield, gradually replaced the bow. Drilled infantry—wielding pikes and firearms—replaced massed ranks of archers, and formed the core of the new line of battle.
To pay for their new armies, 
rulers steadily began to centralize their domains. More efficient taxation systems and bureaucracies were established, curbing the power of an aristocracy whose influence was already diminished by the decline of the feudal system. 
Victory at Castillon, guaranteed 
by gunpowder, ensured the survival of an independent France that was becoming more like a centralized state and less like a feudal country. As a result of the French triumph, France was able to consolidate the territory under its control and the map of this part of western Europe began to take on its modern form. England, bereft of its European possessions, also became more centralized, and its rulers turned away from contintental Europe, leveraging the country’s resources to begin maritime exploration of the Atlantic and North America.

 THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE (1492 ONWARDS)
The arrival in the 1490s of 
the first Europeans in North and Central America 
reconnected ecosystems that had developed in isolation from one another for thousands of years. In the so-called Columbian Exchange, lives and economies that had altered only gradually over centuries were suddenly transformed by the influx of new crops, animals, technology, and pathogens. Many of the effects were unforeseen and misunderstood by both Europeans and American Indians at the time, but once the first landing had been made, there was no turning back. 
Food and farming
When Europeans began to settle  in the Americas, they brought with them their own domesticated animals and foods. The enormous range included citrus fruits, grapes, and bananas; coffee, sugar cane, rice, oats, and wheat; and cattle, sheep, pigs, and horses. To cultivate their crops and pasture their animals, the settlers cleared huge areas of woodland, destroying the habitats of some native wild species in the process, and unintentionally contaminating American fields with the seed of weeds such as dandelion and sow thistle. The exchange in the other direction brought potatoes, tomatoes, sweet corn, beans, pumpkins, squash, and tobacco to the Old World, as well as turkeys and guinea pigs.
The introduction of new staple 
crops transformed lives on both sides of the Atlantic. Potatoes and maize, carbohydrate-rich and easily grown, helped overcome chronic food shortages in Europe and, along with manioc and sweet potatoes, spread on to Africa and Asia.

Biological catastrophe
The most immediately devastating impact of the Columbian Exchange followed the introduction of new diseases into the Americas.

 MARTIN LUTHER’S 95 THESES (1517)
In the autumn of 1517, Martin 
Luther, a monk and teacher of theology at the University of 
Wittenberg in Germany, set off a chain reaction that would transform Europe. Deeply concerned by what he saw as corrupt practices in the Catholic Church, he wrote a series of 95 theses—arguments—against them, which he then circulated within the university. According to some reports, he also nailed them to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg. The theses were soon published more widely, prompting Pope Leo X to charge Luther  with heresy. Luther responded by breaking with the Catholic faith,  IN CONTEXT

so initiating the Reformation—the 
rise of churches based on reformed practices, and a focus on scripture rather than on priestly authority. Because of the churches’ origin in protests against Catholic practices and beliefs, they became known as Protestant churches.
Spread of the Reformation
Luther was not alone in seeking religious reform. Swiss preacher Ulrich Zwingli (1484–1531) led a Protestant church based in Zurich, and Frenchman John Calvin broke from the Catholic church in around 1530. Forced to flee France, he went to Geneva, Switzerland, where he supported the reform movement, eventually helping to shape Protestant doctrine.
Reformers’ beliefs did not 
necessarily concur. Calvinists were markedly different from Lutherans, and Anabaptists were persecuted by Protestants as well as Catholics for their radical views. Luther himself supported the brutal suppression of the Anabaptist-led Peasants’ Revolt in the 1520s. What the Protestants had in common was that their views brought them into fundamental theological conflict with the Catholic church. 
Reformers’ ideas spread via the 
relatively new technology of the printed word. Before movable type and presses made printed books possible in the 1450s, books were all written by hand in Latin, the international language of the church. Print allowed information to be reproduced cheaply and quickly, and demand rapidly grew for books written in the vernacular. Luther wrote his theses in Latin, but before long they had been translated and printed in German, French, English, and other languages. Books and pamphlets describing church abuses and outlining Protestant theology soon followed, and were printed in large numbers. THE EARLY MODERN ERA

A central idea in Protestant theology was that authority came not from the priesthood, but from scripture itself. For this reason, access to  the Bible was essential both for  the reformers and their followers.  Bibles printed in native European languages were appearing by the 16th century, Luther’s German translation of the New Testament was published in 1522, and a translated version of the whole  Bible including the Apocrypha followed in 1534.

in English. A French translation  
by theologian Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples (c.1450–1536) appeared between 1528 and 1532.

also Calvinists in France, where 
they were called Huguenots,  
although that country was split between Catholics and Protestants, who fought in the Wars of Religion of the second half of the 16th century. Spain, Portugal, and  Italy remained Catholic. 
In England, the seeds of reform 
were sown early. Many people objected to abuses such as the use of church funds to pay for clerics—including the Pope and foreign bishops—to lead a life of luxury. However, Protestant ideas were  not yet widely enough held for the faith to take hold. Things changed when Henry VIII of England broke with Rome in 1534, rejecting papal authority and proclaiming himself head of the church in England. As supreme ecclesiastical leader, he exercised his sole right to authorize the publication of the English Bible, the Coverdale Bible, but English religious practice and doctrine remained Catholic. A moderate form of Protestantism was later established in England under Henry’s daughter Elizabeth I.
Reformers risked their lives by 
speaking out at a time when heresy was punishable by death. Czech reformer Jan Hus had been burned at the stake in 1415, Zwingli died in a battle between Protestant and Catholic forces in 1531, and English Bible translator William Tyndale was executed in 1536. Luther, urged to recant by Pope Leo X in 1520, threw the written request on a bonfire, so church authorities handed him over to Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony and founder of the University of Wittenberg, for punishment. Frederick convened a formal enquiry or “Diet” at Worms, at which Emperor Charles V presided. The emperor rejected Luther’s arguments and banned his views in the empire, but Luther refused to recant. He was outlawed and excommunicated, but Frederick saved him from execution by faking his abduction, then hiding him  
at the Wartburg castle. Luther continued to write and organize, garnering increasing support. 
Powerful allies
Support from people in positions  of power assisted the spread of the Reformation. Like Henry VIII in England, the princes of Germany resented church wealth, taxation, and its independent law courts,  and were also eager to strengthen their own power. Throughout the Middle Ages, popes had made alliances with kings and emperors, and intervened in secular affairs. Many German princes wanted to prevent such alliances by cutting ties with Rome and removing bishops from their princedoms, so  
their support for the reformers was motivated by political expedience as well as personal piety.MARTIN LUTHER’S 95 THESES
In what would become the first in  
a long list of religiously motivated conflicts between Catholics and Protestants, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V invaded Lutheran territory in an effort to stamp out the movement. Lutherans united against him and, despite his triumph at the Battle of Mühlberg in 1547, he was unable to suppress them. A temporary compromise was eventually reached at Augsburg in 1555 when the emperor conceded that each prince within the empire could choose how to worship in his own domain. The peace was not to last, however; bitter divisions drawn  
by the Reformation would cause people across Europe to take up arms again, and the continent was ravaged by more than a century  
of religiously-motivated conflict. 
Reform from within 
Even before Luther wrote his 95 theses, a movement for reform had begun within the church. Inspired partly by Renaissance Humanism, it brought on a resurgence of scholarship and philosophy, and motivated churchmen such as Spaniard Francisco Ximenes,  
who produced a Bible with texts in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Aramaic. I do not accept the  
authority of popes and 
councils, for they  
have contradicted  
each other.

masterpieces of High Roman Baroque, by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the leading sculptor of his day.However, Luther’s clear theological 
challenges prompted the papacy to prepare a more widely considered response. In 1545, Paul III called together the Council of Trent at which bishops and cardinals reaffirmed Catholic doctrines, from the importance of the priesthood and sacraments to the legitimacy  of indulgences. But the council  also introduced reforms: it forbade abuses such as the holding of multiple offices by one priest, set up training seminaries for priests, and, in an attempt to slow the spread of Protestant doctrine, established a commission to specify which books Catholics were forbidden to read. In addition, a number of popes from Paul III onward lived austerely, appointed like-minded bishops,  
and reviewed papal finances.
Counter-Reformation  
The council met periodically for  18 years, and provoked a renewal and resurgence of Catholicism from within the church that is usually called the Counter-Reformation. The new Society of Jesus (also known as the order of Jesuits), founded by Spanish knight Ignatius Loyola in 1534, was approved by the pope in 1540 as an answer to the Reformation, and it spread  a powerful Counter-Reformation message across Europe. The contemporary revival of Christian art, which coincided with the flowering of the baroque style in Italy, added a vibrant emphasis. THE EARLY MODERN ERA
Baroque churches were imposing and ornate, filled with affecting sculptures, paintings, and strikingly posed biblical scenes. This potent propaganda served to underline the difference between Catholic churches and their Protestant counterparts, which were usually plain and undecorated. Baroque art, together with the zeal of reforming popes and Jesuit priests, helped to ensure that the Catholic church survived and flourished in countries such as Italy and Spain, even while the Protestant movement was gathering strength elsewhere. Europe, which had once been united under the pope in the  Roman Catholic Church, was now irrevocably split into Catholic and Protestant states. The seeds were sown for over a century of conflict as subjects took up arms against their rulers, kings and princes clashed, and nations attacked nations in the name of religion.

The trio landed some 65 ft (20 m) 
below in a dung heap stacked against the castle walls. Known  
as the Defenestration of Prague, this event began the Thirty Years’ War, a series of conflicts that devastated huge areas of Europe.
Religious differences
The Defenestration took place in  the wake of long-standing disputes between Catholics and Protestants about whether people should be allowed to worship freely in their own way. These differences affected much of Europe, and before war ignited Bohemia, there were violent religious conflicts in several other parts of the continent.
The disputes also involved 
rivalries for power between royal and aristocratic families who favored the different sides and used the conflicts to promote their own interests. The Netherlands,  for example, were home to many Protestants, but were ruled by Catholic Spain, whose ruler Philip II wanted to eliminate Protestantism. The largely Protestant Seven Provinces in the northern Low Countries revolted against the king’s rule. Religious clashes escalated into violence against  the perceived repression of the Habsburg Crown, leading to the formation of the independent Dutch Republic in the north of the region. 
Philip also planned to conquer 
England, which was moderately Protestant under Elizabeth I,  
and wanted to place a Catholic monarch on the English throne. In 1588, he sent his famous Armada to invade the country, but a combination of superior English THE DEFENESTRATION OF PRAGUE

Philip II of Spain, 1566 In May 1618, a group of 
Protestant leaders in Prague met a number of councillors in 
an upper room in Prague Castle. The councillors were Catholics, working as regents for Ferdinand, the new king of Bohemia (now part of the Czech Republic); the Protestants wanted to be sure that the king  
and regents would not remove the religious freedoms that their former rulers had granted them. When  
the regents refused to give this assurance, the Protestants threw two of them, together with their clerk, out of the castle window.

naval tactics and stormy weather foiled the attempt, and England remained independent.
These religious differences 
proved particularly devastating in 16th-century France, where the substantial Protestant minority generally known as the Huguenots were widely persecuted. Many Protestants, especially Calvinist ministers, had their tongues cut out, or were burned at the stake.  
In the so-called St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre of 1572, a group of targeted assassinations followed  by a wave of mob violence against the Huguenots lasted several weeks and left thousands dead. 
There followed a series of so- 
called Wars of Religion that lasted some 36 years. After eight periods of fighting, punctuated by uneasy truces and broken agreements,  
the wars came to an end in 1598 when the French king Henry IV, who had been a Protestant leader before taking the throne, promulgated the Edict of Nantes. This agreement gave the Huguenots certain rights, including freedom of religion in particular geographical areas. It also maintained Catholicism as  
the established religion in France, and obliged Protestants to observe Catholic holidays and pay church taxes. Disputes between the two sides still flared from time to time, however, and many Huguenots  
left France to seek safety in other countries such as England and  the Netherlands. 
Thirty Years’ War
The religious wars and disputes  
in France, the Netherlands, and England formed a troubled backdrop to the Thirty Years’ War in Europe. Most people in Bohemia were Protestants, but the area was part of the large Holy Roman Empire, which also included Germany, Austria, and Hungary, and was ruled by Catholic Habsburg emperors. The emperors acted as overlords to local kings, princes, and dukes. Some of them, notably Matthias, who was on the throne when the Defenestration took place, granted their Protestant subjects the right to worship as they wished. Matthias achieved this by ratifying the Letter of Majesty,  
a charter that had been signed by  
the previous emperor, Rudolf II, which guaranteed Protestants religious freedom and certain other basic rights. However, Matthias’ successor, the ardently Catholic Ferdinand, felt no obligation to honor the Letter of Majesty. He suppressed Protestant churches and appointed Catholics to high positions. This reignited a dispute that had existed in Bohemia since the first stirrings of the Protestant Reformation in the 15th century. 
After the Defenestration, both 
sides began preparing for war,  
but the process was accelerated when, in 1619, Matthias died. Ferdinand, who was already King  of Bohemia, then also became  
Holy Roman Emperor. Bohemia’s Protestant leaders tried to reduce the Catholic emperor’s local  
power by deposing him as King  
of Bohemia and inviting their

This agreement gave the Huguenots certain rights, including freedom of religion in particular geographical areas. It also maintained Catholicism as  
the established religion in France, and obliged Protestants to observe Catholic holidays and pay church taxes. Disputes between the two sides still flared from time to time, however, and many Huguenots  
left France to seek safety in other countries such as England and  the Netherlands. 
Thirty Years’ War
The religious wars and disputes  
in France, the Netherlands, and England formed a troubled backdrop to the Thirty Years’ War in Europe. Most people in Bohemia were Protestants, but the area was part of the large Holy Roman Empire, which also included Germany, Austria, and Hungary, and was ruled by Catholic Habsburg emperors. The emperors acted as overlords to local kings, princes, and dukes. Some of them, notably Matthias, who was on the throne when the Defenestration took place, granted their Protestant subjects the right to worship as they wished. Matthias achieved this by ratifying the Letter of Majesty,  
a charter that had been signed by  
the previous emperor, Rudolf II, which guaranteed Protestants religious freedom and certain other basic rights. However, Matthias’ successor, the ardently Catholic Ferdinand, felt no obligation to honor the Letter of Majesty. He suppressed Protestant churches and appointed Catholics to high positions. This reignited a dispute that had existed in Bohemia since the first stirrings of the Protestant Reformation in the 15th century. 
After the Defenestration, both 
sides began preparing for war,  
but the process was accelerated when, in 1619, Matthias died. Ferdinand, who was already King  of Bohemia, then also became  
Holy Roman Emperor. Bohemia’s Protestant leaders tried to reduce the Catholic emperor’s local  
power by deposing him as King  
of Bohemia and inviting their

own candidate, the Protestant 
Frederick V, Elector Palatine,  to rule in his stead.
Frederick’s credentials as a 
Protestant were excellent, not only because of his own faith, but also by marriage: his wife was Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of England’s Protestant king James I. However,  
in order to make Frederick king,  
the Bohemians had to depose a monarch who had been legally crowned, a move that deprived them of support from a number of their potential allies.
In 1620, the forces of Bohemia 
gathered to face those of the Holy Roman Empire at White Mountain, outside Prague. The forces seemed evenly matched: the Protestants under Frederick and Christian of Anhalt had a larger force, but the empire’s soldiers were experienced and well led by the Spanish–Flemish nobleman Field Marshall Tilly, and renowned general Albrecht von Wallenstein. After only one hour, Bohemian forces were crushed— 4,000 dead or taken prisoner compared to 700 of the empire’s forces—and Tilly entered Prague. Frederick fled, and many of the Protestant leaders were executed; ordinary Protestants were ordered to leave or convert to Catholicism; and Bohemia was left devastated, depopulated, and almost powerless. The area remained overwhelmingly Catholic into the 20th century. 
A destabilizing reform  
What happened in Bohemia was  a symptom of the instability of the wider Holy Roman Empire. In its history there had often been power struggles between emperors and local rulers, but a general balance  of power had emerged in which  
the emperor resolved to respect  
the rights of the individual states that made up the empire. This balance was upset by the changes of the Reformation, when Protestant beliefs strengthened in some places (such as Saxony), and Catholicism prevailed in others (such as Bavaria). A series of struggles then escalated into armed conflict. THE DEFENESTRATION OF PRAGUE
Gustavus achieved his decisive 
victory at Breitenfeld with a new, combined-arms approach in which infantry, artillery, and cavalry worked together in self-supporting units.Most of the battles were in the 
German and central European lands. In a few years the Habsburg imperial army, raised for Ferdinand and led by skilled military leader Albrecht Wallenstein, had crushed its rivals in Germany, and gone on to overwhelm Denmark. By 1629, Ferdinand was in a position to reclaim the lands that had passed into Protestant hands.
However, the Protestants still 
had two powerful allies. One was Sweden, under King Gustavus Adolphus, an able military leader; the other was France, a Catholic country, but one that wanted to curtail imperial power. In 1630, Gustavus arrived in Germany with a large army and won a significant victory at Breitenfeld in 1631, with financial assistance from France. 
In the mid-1630s the Habsburgs 
fought back, with the help of Spain. The conflict had now become an all-encompassing war involving virtually every one of Europe’s major countries in a struggle for power. The emperor wanted to win The [Protestant]

back his lands in Germany, while the Spanish wanted their allies the Habsburgs in power so that they could cross Europe with ease  in their hoped-for attack on the Netherlands. France, fearful of being surrounded by the Habsburgs and their allies, continued to try to reduce imperial power. 
The end and the aftermath
By the 1640s, anti-imperial forces were regaining the upper hand. France defeated Spain at Rocroi  
in the Oise valley in 1643, while in 1645, Sweden met the imperial army at Junkau, southeast of Prague. Around half the 16,000-strong imperial army was killed in this bloody battle, and it looked as if  
the Swedes would march on Prague or Vienna. However by this point, both sides were exhausted, and no advance was made on either city. 
The battles of the Thirty Years’ 
War were conducted on a large scale. Forces of thousands came together in cavalry charges backed up by firearms, and large numbers of mercenaries were employed. The battles were fought with professional speed and ruthlessness, but what came after was sometimes even worse. Vast armies committed infamous atrocities as they pillaged huge areas of country to find food, and removed anything that might be useful to their enemies. Rural areas suffered particularly badly  at the hands of the scavenging troops—Germany lost around  20 percent of its population—but trade and manufacturing were also affected by the damage and devastation left behind. Central Europe took decades to recover from the war, although countries with strong trade networks and sea power, such as England and the Netherlands, fared better. 
Repeated artillery battles  
also wore down both armies. Exhausted, the sides eventually came together to make peace. THE EARLY MODERN ERA
Representatives of the empire, Spain, France, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic, as well as rulers  of German princedoms and cities, and other interested parties, assembled in 1648 in two north-German cities, Osnabrück and Münster, to agree the Peace  of Westphalia. The talks could not resolve basic differences between political and religious interests; they did however produce an agreement to end the war, and  the Peace established an overall balance of power among a number of independent nations.
Although Europe was now 
permanently divided into states that were predominantly Catholic or predominantly Protestant, they had agreed to learn to coexist with one another. The Peace set the precedent of creating agreements between nations by means of high-level diplomatic meetings, the like of which have played a key part in international relations ever since.

FOR THE SPIRIT OF REBELLION
 THE CONQUESTS OF AKBAR THE GREAT (1556)  
 
In February 1556, Abu Akbar 
became the new ruler of the Muslim Mughal dynasty in 
northern India, founded 30 years earlier by Turkic-Mongol invaders from Central Asia. The emperor’s forces immediately confronted the army of Hemu, a rival claimant to the throne of Delhi, at the Second Battle of Panipat. The Mughals inflicted a crushing defeat on Hemu, and regained territory lost by Akbar’s father, Humayun. Akbar  then gradually consolidated and extended his authority, annexing all of northern and part of central India. Rulers were deposed and killed and citizens massacred  as once-independent kingdoms became provinces of his empire.IN CONTEXT

Support and survival 
Akbar maintained the political 
unity of his sprawling realm by building an administration capable of expansion as new territories were incorporated. He created a network of highly paid nobles who served as provincial governors, or were employed as commanders of field armies or as part of the central military—the backbone of the empire. He also recruited talented men from across India (and Persia), both Muslim and Hindu, into his government, remunerating them with money or land. 
This system rewarded 
individual merit and loyalty, but kept the administration from becoming too centralized—a distinct advantage in an empire that was difficult to hold together from a single center. The emperor himself was often on the move, traveling with his court and harem in well-appointed tents.  
Another unifying factor was the 
spread of Islam, together with its arts and culture; however, Akbar believed in religious freedom and allowed the empire’s non-Muslim populations, which included a large Hindu majority, to live by their own faiths, laws, and customs. 
Interaction with Persia
Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, and Humayun, Akbar’s father, had developed diplomatic, cultural, and political links with another Islamic empire in the region, Safavid Persia, which stimulated Mughal interest in Persian fine arts such as miniature painting and  the “art of the book.” Akbar set up studios to produce illustrated books in the cities of Fatehpur Sikri  and Lahore (now in Pakistan), and Persian architects and artisans were brought to India to design  and construct palaces, forts, mosques, and public buildings, including Humayun’s tomb  in Delhi. This domed structure inspired major architectural innovations, and a unique Persian-influenced building style developed across the Indian subcontinent.
The Mughal Empire continued 
to prosper under Akbar’s son Jahangir, but later in the 17th century it declined amid religious conflict and economic problems. The emperors were defeated by Afghan invaders, then came under the control of the Marathas, Hindu warriors who dominated Indian affairs in the second half of the  18th century, and finally were taken over by the British after Britain defeated the Marathas in 1818. 
■Akbar
Akbar was just 13 years old 
when he inherited the Mughal throne, and initially ruled under a regent, Bairam Khan, who assisted him in forcibly unifying India’s collection  
of regional kingdoms into a single, centralized political system within which the emperor was the supreme source of authority. 
Under Akbar, the dynasty 
became an artistic as well as military power. Painting and literature blossomed under  
the emperor’s patronage—although he himself was illiterate, he acquired a library of 24,000 books. His capital at Fatehpur Sikri also became a center for religious debate and his court a place of culture and learning. Although he never renounced Islam, Akbar was open to the ideas of other faiths, and he invited Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist philosophers to debate with the Muslim theologians at his court. He even conceived a new religion, which combined elements of all these faiths, with himself as the deity.

Roanoke Island Colony in North Carolina, but within  
five years it is abandoned.
1607  The first permanent 
English settlement in North 
America is founded at Jamestown, Virginia.

The colonists develop a form of government based 
on the pursuit of religious freedom, following the 
English parliamentary model.  English Protestants  seeking religious freedom  sail  
to North America  on the Mayflower .
Other English colonies are 
founded by companies  granted 
royal charters  from the Crown .More religious separatists   
follow, swelling the  
colony’s  population .In 1620, a group of English 
people who could not legally worship as they wished to in 
England set sail across the Atlantic to begin a new life in America. This group later became known as the Pilgrims. They set off on two ships, but one proved unseaworthy so they had to continue in just one, the Mayflower . Winter storms ravaged 
the 66-day crossing and the ship’s main beam fractured. While still aboard, the Pilgrims drew up the Mayflower
 Compact , which pledged 
their loyalty to the Crown but also asserted their right to make their own laws within the English legal framework. They settled at Plymouth and, although many died that first winter, their community endured.
Early colonization 
At that time, England, like other countries, was competing to establish colonies in North America. Jamestown had been founded thirteen years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, but it was not a religious community. The Colony of Virginia, centered around Jamestown, had been established by English colonists in 1607 under

a charter from the Crown, and was their first permanent settlement in the Americas. French explorers had established fur trading posts up  the rivers of Canada; Dutch and Swedish colonists arrived in North America in the early 17th century, and in 1613 the Dutch established  a trading post on the western shore  of Manhattan Island. 
Government and trade
Both Plymouth and Jamestown developed representative institutions in which colonists elected officials to govern their own affairs. Inspired by the English parliamentary model, and growing out of the assertion of rights articulated in the Mayflower Compact , these early developments 
established a model of self-rule  that came to characterize English colonization in North America. 
Each colony had a governor, 
appointed by the British monarch, and a legislature, elected by the colonists. There was often tension between the two, because the legislature had to work within the framework of existing English law. However, the king and government in London, working with the governor, saw the colonies as a resource, rich in raw materials, that they could exploit to their advantage. 
To ensure America remained a 
ready market for British industry, colonial trade was restricted by the Navigation Acts, which required that all commodity trade take  
place in British ships crewed by British sailors. The colonists came to see these measures as a willful suppression of their trade and manufacturing. Tensions arose  on both sides of the Atlantic as British and colonial merchants sought to protect their interests.
Colonial growth
Relations between the colonists and the indigenous peoples of the East Coast were also starting to strain. The increasing colonial population put pressure on land and resources, pushing people west to settle on land belonging to American Indians. 
The groups struggled to coexist 
harmoniously. An uneasy peace, punctuated by violence, typified relations between settlers and American Indians for many years.

Religious persecution
In the early 17th century, the 
English were legally obliged to worship as prescribed by the Church of England. Although the English church had already broken from the Catholic Church, many people still felt that its hierarchical priesthood and set rituals, hymns, and prayers were Catholic features that should be swept away. 
Puritans, so-called because 
of their desire for religious purity, hoped to reform the church from within. Other groups, known as Separatists, set up their own “separate” congregations, but when their leaders were imprisoned or even executed, they moved to the more tolerant Netherlands. Here they could adopt the simpler form of worship they preferred, but it was very hard to earn  
a living because the country’s professional guilds were closed to them. This is part of the reason that the Pilgrims, and later others, decided to seek  
a new life in North America.The Mayflower  attempted to depart 
England on three occasions: from 
Southampton and then Dartmouth  in August, and finally from Plymouth  on September 6, 1620.

with the king, leaving the remainder 
(known as the Rump Parliament) to vote to end the monarchy. Charles was tried for treason against England and was beheaded in 1649, after which England began an 11-year period as a republic.
The causes of war
King Charles I and parliament were natural opponents. Charles was sympathetic to Catholics while parliament was Protestant, and  he believed in the divine right of kings—the idea that the monarch’s appointment is approved by God and so he or she has absolute power. 
The clash first came to a head 
over the king’s repeated attempts to raise money for a war in France. Parliament tried to curb his power to do so by introducing a Petition of Right in 1628, making it a necessity for its members to approve taxation. However, Charles got around this by levying taxes using antiquated medieval laws, selling trading monopolies to raise cash, and ruling without parliament. In 1640, the king was forced to call parliament for the first time in 11 years to raise money to quell a Scottish revolt. Once called, parliament tried to bring in further measures to limit his power, such as making it illegal for the king to dissolve parliament, but he responded by trying to arrest five MPs. The dispute escalated into the First Civil War in 1642. 
The war and its effects
Initially, the Royalists gained  the upper hand but in 1644 the Parliamentarians reorganized their troops under Oliver Cromwell. With their disciplined, professional approach, this “New Model Army” forced Charles to surrender in 1646. However, the king restarted the war two years later, and this Second Civil War—which ended  in a Royalist defeat at the Battle of Preston in 1648—began the chain of events that led to his execution in 1649 and the formation of a republic under Cromwell called  the Commonwealth of England. 
Like Charles, Cromwell found 
relations with parliament difficult, but he tried to bring in reforms.  
King Charles I  
of EnglandThe son of Stuart King James I  
of England (King James VI of 
Scotland) and Anne of Denmark, Charles was born in 1600 and became king in 1625. From the start, he alienated both subjects and parliament with his demands for taxation (mostly to fund wars in France) and his assertion of  
his divine right to rule. He also clashed with the church because of his sympathies with Catholicism (he was married to the French Catholic princess, Henrietta Maria). In addition, he was unpopular in Scotland, where he tried to replace the prevailing presbyterian system of church governance (without bishops) with the more hierarchical episcopal system (with bishops, following the Anglican model), which led to political and military conflict in 1639 and 1640 (known as the Bishops’ War). During the English  
Civil War, he took an active part in leading the Royalist armies until he was captured; initially, he was put under house arrest, then he was imprisoned before his execution in 1649. He continued to assert his divine right to rule during his trial.He ruled with stern Puritan authority, 
imposing it ruthlessly on the Scots and the Irish. Soon after he died, the country—perhaps tired of Puritan austerity—welcomed Charles I’s exiled son home to reign. Charles II agreed to limitations on royal  power and to uphold the Protestant faith, but his heir—his Catholic brother James II—clashed with Anglican bishops and offended Protestants by offering prominent positions to Catholics. 
Fears of having another Catholic 
king mounted until, in 1688, in what became known as the Glorious Revolution, James was deposed. The king was sent into exile and replaced by his Protestant daughter Mary, who ruled with her Dutch husband William of Orange. In 1689, William and Mary accepted a Bill of Rights, which ensured their subjects had basic civil liberties, such as trial by jury, and making the monarchy subject to the law of the land. Britain has remained a constitutional monarchy, in which no king or queen could defy Parliament as Charles I did, ever since.

In 1660, the Company of Royal 
Adventurers Trading to Africa was established in England. 
Its charter, endorsed by the king, gave its ships the exclusive right  to trade on the West African coast, and permitted its members to set up forts there, in exchange for giving the English Crown half the resulting profits. Twelve years later, the company was reorganized as the Royal African Company and given still greater powers: to build forts and “factories” (where slaves were held before being shipped over the Atlantic), and employ its own troops. The company’s particular significance is due to its crucial role in facilitating and developing the  IN CONTEXT

Europeans to ship slaves from West 
Africa. By the 16th century, the Portugese were bringing slaves  in huge numbers to Brazil to work  on sugar cane plantations. Brazil remained the biggest destination for the import of African slaves until the outlawing of the trade. The first English slaving expeditions took place in the 1560s, in which merchants bought captured slaves from African rulers. During the 17th century, with the increase of English colonization, the market for African slaves grew and the Royal African Company took full advantage of it.
Triangular trade
The transatlantic slave trade soon became part of a larger triangular trading network, in which ships took slaves from Africa to the Americas; refilled the holds with goods to transport to Europe; then took European manufactured goods on to Africa for sale, completing the triangle. Ships carried commodities such as sugar, molasses, and coffee from the Caribbean to England; rice, indigo, cotton, and tobacco from the southern colonies in North America; and furs, timber, and rum from the northeast. On the England-  
to-Africa leg, they carried a range of items including cloth, guns, iron, and beer. Goods such as ivory and gold were carried directly from Africa to Europe, not as part of the triangular trade but still bolstering the system. 
The trade network brought  
huge profits to plantation owners  in the Americas, and to English manufacturers, as well as to the merchants who dealt in the slaves and other goods. Port operators, West African leaders who sold slaves, bankers who loaned money for expeditions, and even English factory workers whose jobs depended on raw materials imported from abroad, all benefited. 
As a key part of this trading 
network, the slave trade made possible the rapid rise of Western capitalism in the 18th century. Even factories some distance away from England’s trading ports became involved. A notable example was the business of arms manufacture, which was based in the English Midlands at population centers such as Birmingham, conveniently close to supplies of iron. Some 150,000 guns, mostly made in these Midland factories, were exported to West Africa every year; almost all of them

were then exchanged with African 
merchants for slaves. English cutlery from Birmingham and Sheffield was also traded in the same way. So many people had vested interests in the triangular trade that it became difficult for European politicians even to criticize the system, let alone abolish it.
The number of people who were 
enslaved and traded was vast. It has been estimated that by the time the slave trade was outlawed in Britain in 1807, British merchants had forced some 3 million Africans into lives of slavery in the Americas. Unknown numbers of people did not even reach America, but died en route in the appalling conditions on board the slave ships. It is likely that even more were carried by Portuguese traders bound for Brazil; ships from other nations carried smaller numbers. Some historians have estimated the total number at around 10 million; others put the figure still higher.I herded them as

European colonies
Spanish, Dutch, and French settlers pioneered the plantation system in the Caribbean, producing crops such as sugar and coffee on huge farms, or plantations. Their principal Caribbean colonies included Cuba (a colony of Spain), Haiti (France), and the Dutch Antilles (the Netherlands). The use of slave labor on these plantations generated substantial profits for owners. The British presence in the area increased in the 17th century, when Britain’s most successful colony was Barbados, where there were 46,000 slaves by the 1680s. In the 18th century there was also a sugar boom in Jamaica. 
Most of the native populations 
were wiped out in the European conquests, and European workers did not fare well in the local conditions, so plantation owners increasingly relied on merciless exploitation of slaves. Slavery was also prevalent in the colonies of North America, especially the southern areas where crops such as tobacco were grown on plantations. Slaves were often treated as non-human objects, forced into labor and subjected to cruelties such as beating, branding, and worse. 
Slavery beyond the triangle
Colonists from Europe also practiced slavery beyond the Atlantic trading triangle. The Dutch pioneered slave trading in Southeast Asia, and also traded across the Indian Ocean with areas such as Madagascar and Mauritius. Most of this trading was conducted under the auspices of the Dutch East India Company, which had its eastern headquarters on the island of Jakarta, known to the Dutch as Batavia, as well as a base in Sri Lanka. From these points they sent slaves around  the Indian Ocean, from eastern THE EARLY MODERN ERA
Indonesia to southern Africa. Once the Portuguese and English had set up bases, there was also further slave trading along the Indian coast. 
The slave trade was not solely 
carried out by Europeans. Muslim merchants also transported slaves from East Africa for sale elsewhere in the Muslim world. 
However, the triangular trade 
was a crucial element in the creation of a global economy run  by Europeans and their colonial offshoots for their own profits. It permitted a phenomenal growth in the wealth of countries that ran the trade. In Britain, for example, the value of foreign trade rose from £10 million at the beginning of the  18th century to £40 million at  the end. But the human cost of the trade in slaves, which influenced patterns of thought and behavior  for centuries to come, remains incalculable today.

it generated accelerated the development of European economies, the trade also displaced millions of Africans.

The company was a vast enterprise—in effect, the first international corporation—and it was created to facilitate trading expeditions to Asia. Unusually, the Dutch government had granted  the company the power not only to trade, but also to build fortifications, establish settlements, raise armies, and enter into treaties with foreign rulers. Since the organization had  
a huge network of ships, ports, and personnel, it required considerable funding and many investors. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange was IN CONTEXT

An expanding economy
In the 17th century, the Netherlands  was growing economically despite being involved in a long war with Spain. The northern part of the region (the Dutch Republic, which was Protestant) had split from the southern half (Flanders, which was Catholic) in the late 16th century. The Republic consisted of seven separate northern provinces, each with a great deal of independence but under the umbrella of a federal government called the States-General. Protestant merchants who had lived in Catholic cities, such  
as Antwerp, moved north to escape persecution, taking with them  their capital and trading links.  Also, many Flemish artisans who were skilled in textile production (primarily weaving wool, silk, and linen) emigrated to the northern cities of Haarlem, Leiden, and Amsterdam, boosting the Dutch Republic’s economy further. 
As the 17th century progressed, 
the Republic really began to prosper. Various factors came together to make this small region successful. Most importantly, the nation had a strong tradition of seafaring, giving it a huge advantage over many other countries. In addition, its citizens had a strong work ethic—largely due to the Protestant belief that THE EARLY MODERN ERA
worldly work was a duty and a route to salvation—so productivity was high. There was also a growing population (especially of the urban middle classes) and an expanding major city—Amsterdam—which proved an ideal center for trade.  All of these contributing factors resulted in the Dutch economy moving increasingly toward shipping, trading, and finance.
Exploration and trade
As a coastal nation, the Dutch Republic produced notable sailors and explorers, so long-distance trading was a natural consequence of the country’s maritime history.  In addition, advancements in ship-building technology in the Republic enabled the Dutch merchant fleet to expand rapidly; by 1670, the Dutch had more merchant ships than the rest of Europe put together.

Agricultural revolution
The expanding population of  
the Dutch Republic in the 17th 
century encouraged farmers  
to make agriculture much more productive. In large part, this was achieved through continued land reclamation—a process that was already well underway by the late Middle Ages. The Dutch also changed the way they used their land. Instead of growing grain one year and letting the land lie fallow the next, farmers began planting certain nitrogen-producing crops (such as peas, turnips, and clover, which they could use as animal feed), in order to improve the soil ready for the next corn crop. Growing more fodder meant that farmers could keep larger herds, thereby increasing production of meat and milk as well as manure, which could be used as fertilizer. This greater productivity helped to sustain a growing population, although some wheat still had  
to be imported to make up the shortfall. It also freed up larger segments of the population to work in trade or finance rather than agriculture.

Instead of growing grain one year and letting the land lie fallow the next, farmers began planting certain nitrogen-producing crops (such as peas, turnips, and clover, which they could use as animal feed), in order to improve the soil ready for the next corn crop. Growing more fodder meant that farmers could keep larger herds, thereby increasing production of meat and milk as well as manure, which could be used as fertilizer. This greater productivity helped to sustain a growing population, although some wheat still had  
to be imported to make up the shortfall. It also freed up larger segments of the population to work in trade or finance rather than agriculture.

The expanding merchant class saw 
large potential profits in the spice trade with Asia and, as in other maritime cultures such as Spain and Portugal, navigators sought new sea routes to the east. The Dutch traveled all over the globe and set up colonies, including one in North America: New Amsterdam, which they officially settled in 1624 and was renamed New York when the British took over. In 1596, the Dutch explorer Willem Barentsz tried to find a northern passage to Asia and in the process discovered Svalbard (Spitsbergen), which later became  a destination for Dutch whalers. 
Most importantly for their 
prosperity, from 1595 the Dutch began to make regular journeys  to Southeast Asia to trade in spices, particularly pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon. They established colonies in the region and founded the city of Batavia, later renamed Jakarta. With this permanent base, the Dutch had the ability to trade long-term, producing a massive boost to their economy.
A need for investment
While the wealth generated by exploration and trade was injected back into the Dutch economy, at the same time investment was required to cover the considerable costs of overseas expeditions. A trading voyage to Asia in the 17th century was a very risky venture—the potential profits were high, but storms at sea, pirates, warfare, or an accident could lead to the loss  of a ship, crew, or cargo and wipe out all the profits. It therefore made sense for many people to invest in each voyage and spread the risk, rather than one entity shouldering all the costs and responsibilities. Private trading companies were set up, each investing a small amount in a larger whole, and all being  well they would then receive a commensurate share of the profits. 
Birth of the Exchange
In 1602, these trading companies merged to form the Dutch East India Company, and shares in the THE OPENING OF THE AMSTERDAM STOCK EXCHANGE

new Stock Exchange in Amsterdam. It was established at the outset that the owners could buy and sell these shares, and very quickly other companies were listing their own shares on the Stock Exchange in order to raise money. The ease of buying and selling shares meant that the Stock Exchange became very busy indeed, fueling the growth of capitalism in this part  of Europe; increased investment resulted in more industry, which then led to further investment and the generation of greater wealth. 
A history of trading
The Amsterdam Stock Exchange did not develop in a vacuum. Buying and selling securities—tradable financial assets such as shares—already had a long history in Europe. By the 14th century, possibly earlier, merchants in rich Italian trading cities, such as Venice and Genoa, had traded in securities. However, the prevailing conditions in the Netherlands in the 17th century meant that the market was especially buoyant. Since the 16th century, there had If one were to lead a

of Amsterdam and ask  
him where he was,

been a strong financial market in Amsterdam, where there was a tradition of trading in commodities and speculation in everything from whale oil to tulips. The idea of buying and selling shares therefore appealed in this entrepreneurial society, especially as there was  a good prospect of healthy profits from the Asian trade. In addition, the unique way in which the exchange traded—opening for limited hours only—encouraged rapid buying and selling and produced a very fluid market. 
Boosts to the economy
The opening of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange was followed in 1609 by the foundation of the Bank of Amsterdam—the forerunner of modern national banks. The bank provided a secure place to keep money and bullion, and it assured that local currency kept its value.  It thus helped to make the Dutch Republic more financially secure, underpinning the vigorous and often risky trading activity that went on in this burgeoning market.
In 1623, the market had a further 
boost when the Dutch East India Company negotiated a new charter, paying investors a regular dividend and permitting those who wanted to leave the company to sell their shares on the Stock Exchange. This action further increased trade on the Stock Market, which was also pioneering other lucrative activities such as futures trading. 
The insurance business was 
also thriving in Amsterdam during this time—particularly marine insurance, which had been created in the 16th century to protect ship owners and investors against the risks of long-distance voyages. When the Stock Exchange opened, a special area was set aside for the buying and selling of insurance. 
A flourishing culture
The very buoyant financial activity prevalent in Amsterdam in the 17th century encouraged the expanding middle classes to buy consumer goods, including fine furniture and oil paintings, further fueling the economy of this already successful region. A particularly strong art market developed, allowing major painters—such as Vermeer and Rembrandt, as well as numerous lesser followers—to flourish. Many artists were specialists, satisfying a growing demand for portraits, landscapes, seascapes, and still THE EARLY MODERN ERA
lifes, although great artists like Rembrandt excelled in all genres and art forms, including painting, drawing, and printmaking.
The increasing wealth also led 
to the expansion of towns, with new town halls, warehouses, and merchants’ homes springing up. Numerous brick houses, owned by the middle classes, survive in cities such as Amsterdam and Delft, many of them set on the banks of the canals that were built during this period—a time of economic boom that combined elegance and artistic flair with success in trade.

 THE BATTLE OF SEKIGAHARA (1600)
On October 21, 1600 there 
was a momentous battle in Sekigahara, central Japan, 
between two warring factions—the Eastern and Western armies—who were both fighting for control of the country. The Eastern Army, under the leadership of the lord Tokugawa Ieyasu, won a decisive victory. Three years later, the Emperor of Japan awarded Ieyasu the title of shogun, granting him the power to rule the country on the emperor’s behalf. Ieyasu brought stability and peace to Japan and transferred the nation’s capital to Edo (now Tokyo), creating a new focus for Japanese culture as well as a central power base.

by the 1460s the local feudal lords 
(daimyos ) were so powerful that  
few shoguns had control over them, as they and their armies of samurai warriors fought to win the right to appoint the shogun’s successor. By the time of the Battle of Sekigahara, Japan had endured bitter factional struggles between its ruling classes for over a century.
Ieyasu’s victory at the battle  
put an end to this Warring States Period. His steady rule, followed by that of the Tokugawa shoguns who succeeded him, ushered in a 250-year period of stability.
The Tokugawa shoguns
In many respects, the Tokugawa shoguns modeled themselves on earlier rulers—particularly Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Although he was not sufficiently high-born to become a shogun, Hideyoshi (who ruled under the lesser title of imperial regent) had brought unity to Japan in the 1580s by imposing a military, feudal style of rule whereby he wielded great power through the daimyos and their samurai warriors. The Tokugawa shoguns decided to govern in the same way, with the daimyos keeping order in their local areas. As an extra precaution, Ieyasu made the daimyos spend alternate years in Edo to ensure they would not build up local power bases; he also suppressed rivals ruthlessly. 
The shoguns encouraged an 
ethic of loyalty and developed an elite bureaucracy. They improved Japan’s road network, promoted education, and standardized the currency. The shogunate also tried to reduce foreign influence in Japan by expelling foreigners and limiting contact with the outside world. Exceptions were made for strictly controlled trade with the Chinese, Koreans, and the Dutch East India Company; all other Europeans were distrusted, as the shoguns believed that they had plans to convert the Japanese to Christianity and gain political power. Furthermore, the Japanese people were forbidden to travel and build ocean-going ships. This policy of isolation virtually cut off Japan from Western influence until the mid-19th century. 
The “floating world”
The capital Edo became the center of a thriving urban culture during the Tokugawa shogunate. Japanese literary forms, such as the haiku   
(a short poem consisting of three lines and 17 syllables) flourished,  as did the distinctive theatrical forms of kabuki  (which combines 
theater and dance) and the bunraku  
puppetry theater. It was also a time of major achievements in the visual arts, particularly landscape painting and woodblock printing. 
The capital’s elite became 
increasingly hedonistic, with their lifestyle frequently described as the “floating world” ( ukiyo ). Originally, 
Buddhists had used the term ukiyo  
to mean “sorrowful world,” reflecting their opinion that life on earth was transitory and expressing a desire to reach a more permanent place, free from suffering and all earthly desires. However, in the Edo Period the homonym 
ukiyo  (“floating”) was 
used to describe the joyful aspect of the ephemeral material world, reflecting the pleasure-seeking mood of the day. 
■Tokugawa Ieyasu The samurai leader Tokugawa 
Ieyasu (1542–1616) was the son  
of a minor Japanese warlord from Mikawa in central Japan. As a young man, he received a military training before becoming an ally of more powerful warlords, such as Oda Nobunaga (1534–82)—one of the most brutal leaders of the turbulent Warring States Period  
in Japan—and his successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536–98). Working with Nobunaga and Hideyoshi, Ieyasu not only built  
up large personal landholdings, but he also learned the key values of loyalty and military power that enabled Hideyoshi to bring a brief period of unity to Japan. When Hideyoshi died, Ieyasu rose to the fore. As shogun,  
he was able to impose stability on his country, but he formally abdicated after only two years in favor of his son, Hidetada,  
to secure a smooth succession and establish a pattern of shoguns passing on their office, helping to ensure that the Tokugawa shogunate was long lasting. Although Hidetada had officially become shogun, Ieyasu remained the effective ruler of Japan until his death.

In 1644, the Manchu—a semi-
nomadic people who had built a large state to the northeast of 
China’s Great Wall—seized Beijing from the crumbling Ming regime and established their own dynasty, the Qing, as the rulers of northern China. Seventeen years later, after fierce fighting on an epic scale, the Qing had overcome the determined resistance of Ming loyalists, and extended their power across mainland China. However, their dynasty was still not secure—in 1673, Kangxi, the second emperor, was forced to confront a major uprising, which became known as the Revolt of the Three Feudatories.
The Three Feudatories were 
vast areas of south China that had been granted as semi-independent fiefdoms to three turncoat Ming generals who had assisted the Qing in their conquest of China. Over time, the fiefdoms became increasingly autonomous, but when Kangxi declared that they would not be hereditary, the generals rebelled. The ensuing struggle was hugely costly in terms of loss of life and economic disruption, and for a while, it seemed that one general, Wu Sangui, would topple the Qing. However, he was finally defeated by Kangxi’s supporters, and in 1683, the Qing eliminated the last stronghold of Ming support on Taiwan, which they then occupied.
 With the Qing now undisputed 
rulers of China, Kangxi embarked on military campaigns that added parts of Siberia and Mongolia to  the Chinese empire, and extended its control over Tibet. Under his exceptional leadership, and that  
Qianlong employed  the Italian Jesuit 
Giuseppe Castiglione as court painter, 
and his imperial portraits fused elements of Chinese scroll painting with Western realism and perspective. IN CONTEXT

He appointed Jesuits to the imperial board of astronomy, and it was a Jesuit who made the first accurate map of Beijing.

Newton published the first edition of his Mathematical 
Principles of Natural Philosophy ,

examines the way objects behave in motion, describes gravity, and explains the movements of planets and satellites. Although it built  on the work of earlier scientists such as Galileo, Huygens, and Kepler, the work was revolutionary. By illustrating how the same  
force—gravity—is responsible for movements both on Earth and in the heavens, it united two scientific realms that had previously been thought separate.
A lasting influence
Newton’s use of mathematics-based theory to explain phenomena was part of a wider scientific revolution. English essayist Francis Bacon insisted that scientists test their observations using reasoned argument, and French philosopher René Descartes championed the use of mathematics and logic to address scientific questions. By emphasizing the importance of human reason, such philosophers broke free from the notion that explanations of  the physical world depended on Christian faith and church doctrine. This paved the way for the intellectual movement called the Enlightenment, and even for the work of later scientists such as Albert Einstein, who modified  and refined Newton’s theories.

minister Cardinal Mazzarin, the 23-year-old Louis XIV 
of France declared that he would now rule alone, as an absolute monarch. During his 72-year reign (1643–1715), Louis dominated his subjects, cultivating the image of  a “Sun King” around whom the country orbited. Louis saw his power as God-given, and himself as the embodiment of the state, with the nobility, the middle classes, and peasants dependent on him for justice and protection. 
To maintain this position, 
Louis controlled the historically unruly aristocracy. He compelled them to attend his court, where he dispensed privileges and positions via a system of etiquette. He filled the treasury’s depleted coffers by appointing members of the upper-middle classes to collect taxes  
in the provinces. Taxation was extensive and the burden fell mainly on the peasantry. Louis’s finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, whose overhaul of France’s trade and industry helped to make the country Europe’s leading power, increased the efficiency of the revenue system.
Expanding France
Louis’s tax income paid for his court at the dazzling Palace of Versailles, an old hunting lodge extended into  a royal palace, and the venue for extravagant entertainments. From 1682 it became the permanent  
base of the royal court, and the seat of government. Louis also waged  a series of costly dynastic wars to make some territorial gains along France’s frontiers, leading the other European nations to form coalitions against him.
Peace was finally achieved at the 
Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, but brought few gains for France. The country was plunged into debt and opinion turned against the Crown. In spite of this, Louis established a pattern of absolutism in France that lasted, in a more enlightened form, for most of the 18th century until attempts to reform the system resulted in the overthrow of the monarchy in 1792 during the French Revolution.

DIDEROT PUBLISHES THE  
ENCYCLOPÉDIE  (1751)
In the mid 18th century, the 
French philosopher Denis Diderot invited some of his 
country’s leading intellectuals—literary men, scientists, scholars, and philosophers to write articles for a huge “Classified Dictionary  of Sciences, Arts, and Trades,” for which he was both editor-in-chief and contributor. The first volumes of his Encyclopédie  appeared  
in 1751, and the full work was completed 21 years later, made up of 17 volumes of text and another  11 volumes of illustrations.

They sought to apply reason and logic  to explain the phenomena of the natural world, and humankind’s existence, rather than religious  or political dogma. As such, the work challenged both the Catholic Church and the French monarchy, which derived their authority from traditional ideas such as a divinely ordained, unchanging order. 
A revolution in thought
The mission of the Encyclopédie  
was to catalog the collective knowledge of the Western world  
in the spirit of the Enlightenment. This was a multifaceted intellectual movement that took root around 1715, although its origins lay in work done by the pioneers of modern scientific and philosophical thought in the previous century. The work’s multidisciplinary articles, which numbered around 72,000, distilled the ideas and theories of France’s key Enlightenment thinkers—including the writers and philosophers Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Montesquieu. 
The articles were extremely 
wide-ranging, but centered on  three main areas: the need to base society not on faith and the doctrines of the Catholic Church but on rational thought; the importance of observations and experiments in science; and the search for a way of organizing states and governments around natural law and justice. 
Diderot organized the 
Encyclopédie’s articles into three main categories: memory (subjects connected to history); reason (philosophy); and imagination (poetry). Controversially, there was no special category for God or the divine—religion, like magic and superstition, was treated as part  of philosophy. This approach was groundbreaking, and contentious. Religion had been at the very heart of life and thought in Europe for THE EARLY MODERN ERA

adherence to a faith. They argued 
that “truths” about the tangible world, which had been set down in antiquity by Aristotle and others, and upheld by the Church, should be tested through experimentation and observation, checked, and then discussed in a rational way.
This radical mode of thinking 
had its origins in the scientific revolution of the 17th century. Scientists and philosophers including Francis Bacon, Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton, and Galileo Galilei had transformed the study  of nature and the physical universe, making it more observational. They conducted careful experiments  and subjected their results to mathematical analysis; in the process they drastically updated and expanded the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, and astronomy. 
Enlightenment scientists took 
this investigation of reality further, making possible, for example, Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus’s development of a proper, rational biological classification in the early 18th century. The inquiring,  reason-based approach of the Enlightenment also triggered dramatic technological advances. In the 1760s, the Scottish physician Joseph Black discovered carbon dioxide, while in 1769, Scotsman DIDEROT PUBLISHES THE ENCYCLOPÉDIE
James Watt made improvements to the steam engine that increased its efficiency, thereby enabling the improvement of factories. The Encyclopédie  helped to publicize 
these, and other, achievements of 18th-century scientists, as well as those of their precursors. 
The work also found an 
audience in the learned societies, academies, and universities that flourished in the Enlightenment period. Although many teachers and scholars at Europe’s older, Church-dominated universities remained deaf to the new scientific way of thought, more progressive ones helped to teach and promote it.
 
Equality and freedom
The scientific revolution and the Enlightenment also encouraged the belief that reason could reveal natural laws in human affairs.Instead of drawing fact from faith, Enlightenment thinkers believed that politics should be separated from religion, that neither should curtail the rights of the individual, and that people should be free to express their opinions, worship in their own way, and read what they want to. This political doctrine, which is often labeled liberalism, had roots in the work of 17th-century philosophers such as Englishman Voltaire 
François-Marie Arouet, who 
chose to be known publicly  
by the name Voltaire, was  
one of the greatest writers  
and social activists of the Enlightenment, renowned  
for his wit and intelligence.  
He was born in Paris in 1694, and spent much of his long life there, although he traveled widely and spoke several languages. He was a hugely prolific writer, producing works in almost every literary genre: novels, plays, poems, essays, historical studies, and philosophical books as well as countless pamphlets. 
Voltaire was an outspoken 
supporter of social reform, including the defense of civil liberties and freedom of religion and speech; he also denounced the hypocrisy of the political and religious establishment. This led to the censorship of some of his work, and also to short spells of imprisonment and periods of exile in England—after which he converted his experiences into an influential book, Philosophical Letters on 
the English —and Geneva, 
Switzerland, where he wrote his most famous work, the philosophical novella Candide . 
Scepticism is the first  
step towards truth.

world, priests have been  
the enemies of liberty.

John Locke—the father of liberalism. 
Locke asserted that there are certain intrinsic human rights that are not dependent on law or custom—in other words, they exist quite separately from what the Church or monarch might decree. These rights could be expressed in different ways, but included the right to life, the right to liberty,  
and the freedom to own what one has produced. These ideas were central to Enlightenment thinkers, following Locke, who felt that such natural rights should form the basis of any system of government. 
Liberal ideas also found 
expression in the work of Enlightenment writers. For example, Voltaire, in books such  as the Philosophical Dictionary,  
highlighted the injustices and abuses of the Catholic Church, and espoused values such as tolerance, freedom of the press, and the promotion of reason over doctrine and religious revelation. In his  Spirit of the Law s, Montesquieu 
advocated the separation of governmental powers (legislature, executive, judiciary) and pressed for an end to slavery. In The Social Contract, Jean-Jacques Rousseau rejected the power of the monarch in favor of that of the people, who, he said, must balance rights with duties, and should be able to decide the laws that govern their lives. The contributors to the Encyclopédie  
also promoted liberal values in economics. They were critical of fairs—where goods were sold by visiting dealers at the expense of local traders, who often had to close their businesses for the duration—and favored markets, which allowed local traders to meet the needs of the local population. 
Ideas such as these spread 
across Europe. Conversations and debates on philosophical, political, and scientific subjects took place in the coffee-houses that had sprung up in English, French, German,  and Dutch cities a century earlier. These coffee-houses now served as information-sharing hubs where men from all walks of life, including writers, politicians, philosophers, and scientists, could congregate  to exchange views. 
Into the light
In Europe, the Enlightenment movement, and the Encyclopédie  
itself, which helped promote its ideals, had a profound impact on social, political, and intellectual  life. Its proponents believed that they were sweeping away an oppressive medieval worldview  and ushering in a new era that they hoped would be characterized by freedom of thought, open-mindedness, and tolerance.
The Enlightenment’s 
questioning, rational approach, and urgent demand for liberty, paved the way for the granting of new civil rights. The movement affected the policies of monarchical rulers, such as the freeing of serfs in the Holy Roman Empire in the 1780s. Monarchs who accepted Enlightenment values took on  the movement’s name, titling THE EARLY MODERN ERA
themselves Enlightened Despots. Enlightenment thought also provided the intellectual fuel for  the French Revolution of 1787–99—begun by citizens inspired by Enlightenment notions of individual freedom and equality—and the campaign to abolish the Atlantic slave trade in the 19th century. 
Liberalism and other aspects of 
Enlightenment political philosophy  
began to influence leaders in many parts of the world when they came to draw up legal systems and to establish rights for their citizens—most notably in the fledgling United States, whose Constitution (1789) adopted Montesquieu’s idea of the separation of power into branches of government. 
More generally, the movement 
promoted the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake and recognized that one person’s quest for understanding could benefit the entire human race.

John Locke—the father of liberalism. 
Locke asserted that there are certain intrinsic human rights that are not dependent on law or custom—in other words, they exist quite separately from what the Church or monarch might decree. These rights could be expressed in different ways, but included the right to life, the right to liberty,  
and the freedom to own what one has produced. These ideas were central to Enlightenment thinkers, following Locke, who felt that such natural rights should form the basis of any system of government. 
Liberal ideas also found 
expression in the work of Enlightenment writers. For example, Voltaire, in books such  as the Philosophical Dictionary,  
highlighted the injustices and abuses of the Catholic Church, and espoused values such as tolerance, freedom of the press, and the promotion of reason over doctrine and religious revelation. In his  Spirit of the Law s, Montesquieu 
advocated the separation of governmental powers (legislature, executive, judiciary) and pressed for an end to slavery. In The Social Contract, Jean-Jacques Rousseau rejected the power of the monarch in favor of that of the people, who, he said, must balance rights with duties, and should be able to decide the laws that govern their lives. The contributors to the Encyclopédie  
also promoted liberal values in economics. They were critical of fairs—where goods were sold by visiting dealers at the expense of local traders, who often had to close their businesses for the duration—and favored markets, which allowed local traders to meet the needs of the local population. 
Ideas such as these spread 
across Europe. Conversations and debates on philosophical, political, and scientific subjects took place in the coffee-houses that had sprung up in English, French, German,  and Dutch cities a century earlier. These coffee-houses now served as information-sharing hubs where men from all walks of life, including writers, politicians, philosophers, and scientists, could congregate  to exchange views. 
Into the light
In Europe, the Enlightenment movement, and the Encyclopédie  
itself, which helped promote its ideals, had a profound impact on social, political, and intellectual  life. Its proponents believed that they were sweeping away an oppressive medieval worldview  and ushering in a new era that they hoped would be characterized by freedom of thought, open-mindedness, and tolerance.
The Enlightenment’s 
questioning, rational approach, and urgent demand for liberty, paved the way for the granting of new civil rights. The movement affected the policies of monarchical rulers, such as the freeing of serfs in the Holy Roman Empire in the 1780s. Monarchs who accepted Enlightenment values took on  the movement’s name, titling THE EARLY MODERN ERA
themselves Enlightened Despots. Enlightenment thought also provided the intellectual fuel for  the French Revolution of 1787–99—begun by citizens inspired by Enlightenment notions of individual freedom and equality—and the campaign to abolish the Atlantic slave trade in the 19th century. 
Liberalism and other aspects of 
Enlightenment political philosophy  
began to influence leaders in many parts of the world when they came to draw up legal systems and to establish rights for their citizens—most notably in the fledgling United States, whose Constitution (1789) adopted Montesquieu’s idea of the separation of power into branches of government. 
More generally, the movement 
promoted the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake and recognized that one person’s quest for understanding could benefit the entire human race. 
■To renounce  
liberty is to renounce  
being a man.

 I BUILT ST. PETERSBURG  
 AS A WINDOW TO LET IN  
THE LIGHT OF EUROPE
 THE FOUNDING OF ST. PETERSBURG (1703)
Russian ruler Peter the Great 
founded St. Petersburg, on the estuary of the River 
Neva, on May 27, 1703. This new city, fortress, and port by the Baltic gave Russia direct sea access to Europe, opening new opportunities for both trade and military conquest. In 1712, Peter made his new city Russia’s capital, stripping the title from the ancient seat of Moscow. 
An admirer of Western palaces, 
Peter employed European architects to design the government buildings, palaces, university, and houses in the fashionable baroque style. He also pressed 30,000 peasants each year into construction gangs, along with Russian convict laborers  and Swedish prisoners of war.  
The regimen was strict, and living conditions stark: more than 100,000 workers died, but those who survived could earn their freedom.
The lavish design and vast scale 
of Peter’s architecture showed not only his appreciation of European culture, but also his determination to be an exalted, absolute ruler in the manner of Western despots such as Louis XIV. Peter used his power to make significant changes in IN CONTEXT

Peter transformed his court, making his courtiers adopt French-style dress instead of traditional robes, and ordering them to cut off their long beards.

Influenced by the ideas of the European Enlightenment, she promoted education and the arts, sponsored translations of foreign literary works, and wrote books herself. She too increased Russia’s imperial strength, gaining military victories over the Ottoman Empire. 
The rulers were also influenced

and strong leadership under kings such as Frederick II. Between Prussia and Russia lay Poland, whose territories these two powers and Austria carved up and took over in a series of partitions. This left Russia with influence over  
an area stretching from Eastern Europe to Siberia that it still

THE FOUNDING OF THE 
SAFAVID DYNASTY, PERSIA
(1501)
The Safavid dynasty rose to power 
under Shah Ismail I, a leader of the Twelver School of Shia Islam, which believes in 12 imams as successors to the prophet Muhammad. In a series of military campaigns lasting until 1509, Shah Ismail conquered Persia (now Iran) and areas of Iraq, in the name of Shia Islam. His  son, Shah Tahmasp (r. 1524–76), defended these lands against the neighboring Ottoman empire, whose rulers followed the opposing Sunni School of Islam. The Safavid dynasty established strong Shia rule in Persia, created an efficient government and bureaucracy, and lasted until 1736. 
CHARLES V BECOMES  
HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR
(1519)
One of the most powerful European monarchs as Hapsburg king of Spain and ruler of Burgundy and the Netherlands, Charles V was elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1519, bringing much of central Europe and northern Italy under his rule. This gave him unprecedented power but also brought challenges from the empire’s neighbors—France on  one flank and the Ottomans on  the other—and from Protestants within his territories. When Charles abdicated, the Spanish crown passed to his son Philip and the title of emperor to his son Ferdinand.THE START OF THE  
DUTCH REVOLT
(1568)
In 1568, the Protestant northern provinces of the Netherlands rebelled against their Catholic ruler, Philip II of Spain, and declared their independence, beginning an 80-year period of war before their Republic was recognized. Philip had imposed his Catholic beliefs uncompromisingly on his Dutch subjects, so many Protestants  from the southern Netherlands, which remained loyal to the crown, moved north. This influx helped  the Republic, which soon grew  into a financially and culturally stable nation thanks to sea trade, scientific progress, and impressive artistic achievements.
THE ST. BARTHOLOMEW’S 
DAY MASSACRE
(1572)
In 16th-century France, violent 
clashes, and, from 1562, civil  war, erupted between Catholics and Protestants. One of the worst episodes took place in 1572, when the Protestant claimant to the French throne, Henry of Navarre, was married in Paris and several thousand Protestants were massacred. After Henry became king of France, he issued the  Edict of Nantes in 1598, ordering religious tolerance. However, the edict was revoked in 1685 by Louis XIV, who ruthlessly oppressed France’s Protestant population; FURTHER EVENTS
HENRY VIII BREAKS  
WITH ROME
(1534)
English king Henry VIII faced a dynastic crisis: he needed a male heir to ensure the succession,  but he and his wife, Catherine of Aragon, were unable to produce one. Henry wanted to divorce Catherine, but the Pope refused him permission to do so. In response, Henry cut off ties with Rome and declared himself head of the church in England. Although under Henry the English church remained largely Catholic in doctrine and practice, the king’s move paved the way  for England’s later acceptance of Protestantism. In addition, Henry dissolved the monasteries, which brought him a new source of land and wealth, and removed a key link with the Roman Catholic church.
CARTIER EXPLORES 
CANADA
(1534–42)
French navigator Jacques Cartier 
explored the northern coast of Canada and Newfoundland, sailing up the St. Lawrence River as far  as what later became Montreal. Although he did not establish a  colony there, Cartier sparked the French interest in Canada, and  his explorations were crucial when French travelers began to found settlements there and make claims on the land in the 17th century. Canada has had a significant French heritage ever since.

under his reign many Protestants were imprisoned and many others fled from the country. 
THE SPANISH ARMADA
(1588)
In 1588, the Catholic monarch Philip II of Spain attempted to conquer Protestant England by sending a fleet of 130 ships to invade the country. After the English succeeded in destroying part of the fleet using fire ships,  a defeat at Gravelines sent the remains of the Spanish Armada retreating northward toward Scotland, where many more ships were wrecked by storms. Only 86 vessels made it back to Spain. The defeat was a blow to Spain, ending this campaign to capture England  for Catholicism and confirming England’s status as a secure Protestant nation under Elizabeth I. 
THE JAPANESE INVASIONS 
OF KOREA ARE DEFEATED
(1592–98)
The Japanese samurai leader 
Toyotomi Hideyoshi launched attempts to conquer Korea in  1592 and 1597, part of a larger campaign that was intended to culminate with an invasion of China. Both times, Japan made major advances, but the Koreans, with the support of Chinese forces, managed to fight back. However, they were unable to expel the Japanese completely, which led  to a stalemate on land, although Korea’s Admiral Yi inflicted frequent naval defeats on Japan. Beaten at sea and confined to  a few fortresses on land, Japan abandoned its attempts to invade. Korea remained independent until 1910, after which there was a 35-year period of Japanese rule. 
THE SIEGE OF DROGHEDA
(1649)
England’s parliamentarian leader Oliver Cromwell launched his campaign to conquer Ireland in 1649, after Irish Catholics took  control of the country from its English administrators in 1641. Once Cromwell had taken Dublin, Drogheda became a base for Irish Catholic leaders. Cromwell laid siege to the town, massacring the people inside its walls when they refused to surrender. Most of the garrison of about 2,500 men,  plus many civilians, were killed. Although the killings did not  break the military code of the  time, their ruthlessness and the sheer number of victims were  both unprecedented, and they embittered future relations between the English and the Irish Catholics. 
THE DUTCH ESTABLISH A 
COLONY AT CAPE TOWN
(1650)
Although Portuguese explorers 
were the first Europeans to  
discover the Cape of Good Hope  
in the 15th century, it was the Dutch who founded Cape Town.  
In 1652, a group from the Dutch East India Company under Jan  
van Riebeeck established a colony there, creating a stopping point  
for Dutch ships on their way to  
and from Asia. The settlement became the center of a large community of people of Dutch origin, who dominated trade and agriculture in the region, evolved their own language—Afrikaans—  
and played a central role in the history of South Africa.
THE OTTOMAN SIEGE  
OF VIENNA
(1683)
By 1683, the Turkish Ottoman Empire was at its greatest extent and included large areas of North Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Austria was on  the empire’s western border, and the Turks had already attempted  to conquer Vienna. In 1683 they besieged the city for the last time: the forces of the Habsburg-ruled Holy Roman Empire and of Poland came to defend Vienna, and the Ottomans were vanquished. From this point on, the Ottomans’ power declined. No longer a threat to Christian Europe, they steadily  lost their European territories.
THE BATTLE OF CULLODEN
(1746)
At the Battle of Culloden, Scotland, an army being led by the Duke of Cumberland, son of the Hanoverian king George II, defeated a smaller force of Jacobites (including many from the Highland clans) under Prince Charles Edward Stuart.  The Stuart prince had hoped to restore his bloodline to the British throne, but Culloden effectively  put an end to his campaign. It  also led to the disarming of the Scottish Highlands, where Jacobite support was strongest, the dismantling of the clan system there, and a ruthless suppression  of Highland culture that included bans on wearing Highland dress and speaking Gaelic.

From the late 18th century, 
history took on a perhaps delusory air of “progress.” 
Change accelerated and seemed  to have a clear direction. The world population exceeded 1 billion in 1804 and was approaching 2 billion by 1914. This growth was made possible by tremendous increases in economic output. Agriculture became more efficient and large areas of new land were put to productive use. The exploitation of new sources of energy—especially steam power—the application of new technology, and organized industrial production in factories revolutionized the manufacture  of commodities. Railways made it possible for humans to travel faster than a horse for the first time and cities expanded—for instance, the population in London increased from 1 million in 1800 to 7 million in 1910. Improvements in public health and medicine increased life expectancy in the most advanced countries.
Human rights and equality
Despite these advancements, it  is debatable whether progress  was detectable in the quality of life.  At the start of this period, political revolutions in America and France enunciated principles of human rights and equal citizenship that radically challenged the existing order of society. By the early 20th century, liberals and democrats in Europe and North America could look with some complacency upon successes such as the widespread expansion of voting rights, the abolition of slavery, and freedom of speech. However, women remained mostly excluded from voting, and there was no economic equality. Extremes of wealth and poverty polarized the world’s wealthiest and most advanced societies, and conditions of life for industrial workers were often very miserable. Artists and intellectuals of the Romantic movement criticized the impact of mechanized industry on people and the environment, while socialist movements looked forward to further revolutions that would end the exploitation of man by man and create egalitarian societies. 
Western imperialism
The most obvious losers in the new world order created by industrial capitalism were the inhabitants of countries at the periphery of the global economy. The industrializing countries of the West, needing places to invest their excess capital, INTRODUCTION

raw materials for their factories, and markets for their new products, found them in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They also sought land for their expanding populations to settle in thinly populated zones such as the North American plains and Australia. Peoples who stood  in their way were swept aside. The Europeans started expanding the areas under their direct rule or control. The British takeover of the Indian subcontinent, more or less complete by the mid-19th century, was the most spectacular example of imperialism in action, and Sub-Saharan Africa was divided among the European powers as if the local population did not exist.
The world’s response to Western 
imperialism was mixed. Resistance was widespread in the form of wars and uprisings against European dominance. On the other hand, the growing superiority of the West in technology, science, military power, and social organization led several non-European governments to try to modernize based on the Western model. In the Muslim world, Egypt, Turkey, and Iran attempted, with only partial success, to pursue a modernizing agenda. In East Asia, Japan successfully transformed itself into an efficient modern state, becoming an imperialist power in its own right. China, by contrast, experienced turmoil and invasion, and imperial rule collapsed in the early 20th century.  
Rising nationalism
Most Europeans and people of European descent gloried in a sense of their own racial and cultural superiority to the rest of the world, but Europe remained a deeply divided continent. Militant nationalism, unleashed by the French Revolution, was a threat to stability. By 1815, the Napoleonic Wars had generated battles of unprecedented scale. After the wars of the mid-19th century  that created a unified Italy and Germany, the great powers maintained large conscript armies and formed mutually hostile alliance systems. These armies were equipped with high-explosive shells and rapid-fire weapons.
European military power, which 
was supported by highly organized state systems and economies, was certainly one of the key elements in European world domination. There would be disaster when European states turned this power against one another.

raw materials for their factories, 
and markets for their new products, found them in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They also sought land for their expanding populations to settle in thinly populated zones such as the North American plains and Australia. Peoples who stood  in their way were swept aside. The Europeans started expanding the areas under their direct rule or control. The British takeover of the Indian subcontinent, more or less complete by the mid-19th century, was the most spectacular example of imperialism in action, and Sub-Saharan Africa was divided among the European powers as if the local population did not exist.
The world’s response to Western 
imperialism was mixed. Resistance was widespread in the form of wars and uprisings against European dominance. On the other hand, the growing superiority of the West in technology, science, military power, and social organization led several non-European governments to try to modernize based on the Western model. In the Muslim world, Egypt, Turkey, and Iran attempted, with only partial success, to pursue a modernizing agenda. In East Asia, Japan successfully transformed itself into an efficient modern state, becoming an imperialist power in its own right. China, by contrast, experienced turmoil and invasion, and imperial rule collapsed in the early 20th century.  
Rising nationalism
Most Europeans and people of European descent gloried in a sense of their own racial and cultural superiority to the rest of the world, but Europe remained a deeply divided continent. Militant nationalism, unleashed by the French Revolution, was a threat to stability. By 1815, the Napoleonic Wars had generated battles of unprecedented scale. After the wars of the mid-19th century  that created a unified Italy and Germany, the great powers maintained large conscript armies and formed mutually hostile alliance systems. These armies were equipped with high-explosive shells and rapid-fire weapons.
European military power, which 
was supported by highly organized state systems and economies, was certainly one of the key elements in European world domination. There would be disaster when European states turned this power against one another.

proclaimed by the Declaration of Independence, adopted by the Second Continental Congress

56 delegates present. What would become the United States consisted of 13 British colonies, steadily established since the 17th century, and scattered along the east coast  
of North America. They were not just geographically remote from their mother country; most were also geographically remote from each other. Their economies were fragile, and they had no coherent political identity—citizens of IN CONTEXT

defeat, in October 1781, the British 
surrendered at Yorktown, Virginia. The war would not formally end for another year, but in every important respect, the colonists—and their French allies—had dealt a huge blow to their British masters.
The French involvement in the 
creation of this new nation owed everything to a desire to reverse the humiliations of the Seven Years’ War. But the debts incurred would, ironically, be among the many causes of the bankruptcy of the French crown that led to the French Revolution in 1789. There was a profound irony, too, in absolutist France seeking to win Americans the freedoms that it was unwilling to accord its own citizens.
Revolutionary ideals
At the heart of the American Revolution was the new political philosophy encapsulated by the Declaration of Independence.  It was the work of a distinctly patrician Virginian, a haughty, wealthy slave-owner named Thomas Jefferson. He was one of  a committee of five charged with writing the Declaration, yet the two drafts it went through in June 1776 were almost entirely his own. It is hard to overstate the importance of the Declaration of Independence. It made, for the time, an astonishing claim: “that all men are created equal.” It further claimed “that governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.”
These were actively seditious 
sentiments that neither George III of England nor Louis XVI of France could have any sympathy with. They nonetheless formed the bedrock of what would become  the United States and, indeed, liberal political systems across  the Western world. These political creeds, derived from the work of THE SIGNING OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
In Declaration of Independence , by 
John Trumbull, the drafting committee 
is shown presenting its work to Congress. Thomas Jefferson can be seen standing in a red waistcoat.
British and French Enlightenment 
thinkers, led to the creation of the first modern state and, in doing so, changed the world.
The destiny of America
Jefferson remains an enigma.  He loathed monarchy yet loved pre-Revolutionary France, where  he was the United States’ first ambassador, delighting in its civilized elegance. He claimed to despise high office yet served two terms as President of the United States. And, as president, in 1803 he drove through the Louisiana Purchase, which saw a vast area west of the Mississippi transferred at a bargain price from France, its nominal ruler, to the United States. 
US_204-207_Dec_Independence.indd   206 15/02/2016   16:43207
He understood that the destiny of the US lay in its colonization of the vast lands to the west, he assented to the notion that its indigenous inhabitants should be driven off, and he owned slaves. “Blacks,” he asserted, “are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.” Whereas George Washington, also a patrician Virginian, freed his slaves, Jefferson opted not to. 
None of this, though, can 
diminish Jefferson’s significance in articulating notions of liberty that resonate today. And even though he felt slavery was wrong, his personal belief was that emancipation would be bad for both slaves and white Americans—unless they were returned to Africa.
A new constitution
Although Jefferson can readily be considered the guiding spirit behind the Declaration of Independence, he played no formal role in the drawing up of the next great document that shaped the nation: its Constitution. The United States was legally able to assert its independence from Britain in 1783. But for the next four years, it existed in an increasingly unstable political vacuum, its fate decided by an ever-more divided Confederation Congress, meeting variously in Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey. 
There were serious reasons to 
believe the new nation might fail, torn apart by those arguing for  the primacy of the rights of the individual states over the central government, and those in favor  of a strong central government or even the creation of an American monarchy. In the spring of 1787, a Constitutional Convention took place in Philadelphia. The written, formalized Constitution proposed would not be provisionally ratified CHANGING SOCIETIES
until June the following year, and then only after prolonged disputes. The result was an assertion of a new form of government. It was both a bill of rights and a blueprint for an ideal government, whose three branches—executive, legislative, and judiciary—would keep each other in check. It would have a profound influence on that issued in Revolutionary France in 1791  and remains a model of its kind. 
“Unfinished business” 
The founding fathers were rightly optimistic about the United States’ potential, but they had failed to resolve one crucial question. Jefferson’s first draft of the Declaration of Independence called slavery “an execrable commerce” and “a cruel war against human nature itself.” However, to placate the slave states of the south and the slave traders of the north, these radical statements were later dropped. Almost 90 years later, it would take a civil war and 620,000 dead to end the practice and complete what Abraham Lincoln saw as the “unfinished business”  
of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.

On July 14, 1789, an enraged 
Parisian mob, seeking weapons to defend their 
city from a rumored royal attack, stormed the crumbling fortress known as the Bastille and murdered its governor and guards. This violent defiance of royal power  has become the symbol of the French Revolution, a movement  that not only engulfed France  but also reverberated around the world. The ideas articulated in the revolution spelled the beginning  of the end for Europe’s absolute monarchies and inspired their eventual replacement by more democratic governments. 
The French Revolution originally 
set out to sweep away aristocratic privilege and establish a new  state based on the Enlightenment principles of liberté , égalité , and 
fraternité . But although it was 
introduced by a surge of optimism,  the revolution soon degenerated into a violence that played out  over several years and that would be brought to an end only by the dictatorship of Napoleon Bonaparte. It remains a story of confusion and chaos, of a collision between a privileged old order, the ancien régime , and a new world that 
struggled, often violently, to  create a coherent new order. 
A country in disarray
The French king, Louis XVI, well meaning but indecisive, was  hardly the man to confront any crisis, let alone one as grave as  that facing France in 1789. In the previous century, his great-great-great-grandfather Louis XIV,  the Sun King, had established France as an absolute monarchy, with all power concentrated in the king’s hands, and his palace at THE STORMING OF THE BASTILLE

Louis XVI thus ruled over a 
country where nobles refused to surrender any privileges, and taxes were paid almost exclusively by an oppressed peasantry: France was effectively bankrupt. In the late  18th century, France’s population was expanding rapidly, but unlike England, France had not had an agricultural revolution and remained particularly vulnerable to any failure of the harvest, as happened in  1787 and, again, in 1788. These desperate summers were followed in 1788–89 by a bitterly harsh winter, leading to mass starvation.

It consisted of clergy, the first estate; nobles, the second; and the commons (essentially a kind of bourgeoisie, lawyers predominating), the third. The States General met at Versailles on May 5, 1789. Almost instantly, the nobles and clerics tried to assert that their votes should be worth more than those of the commons. In response, on June 17, the commons declared itself a National Assembly, vesting power in itself instead of the crown. In August, with peasant uprisings across rural France, the Assembly abolished feudal taxes and aristocratic privileges and issued what it called the Declaration of the Rights of Man, a statement asserting fundamental freedoms.
In October 1789, events were 
suddenly accelerated when a vast crowd, outraged by the lack of bread in Paris, descended on Versailles and forcibly removed the royal family to Paris, ransacking the palace for good measure. In what would become an unnerving foretaste of the violence to come, the severed heads of the guards at Versailles were paraded on stakes as Louis and his family were escorted to the capital.
It had been comparatively easy 
to overthrow the existing royal government, but it would prove infinitely harder to establish a new government. It was presumed that  
a kind of constitutional monarchy would be the most obvious solution. In the event, France found itself wrenched between those arguing for this more or less moderate option, and those in favor of a much more radical republican alternative.

abandoned hope of reasserting his 
authority. Large numbers of French aristocrats—emigrés—had already fled France, fearing the revolution had made it unsafe. In trying to persuade other European regimes—  
Austria above all, whose emperor was the brother of the French queen Marie-Antoinette—they stirred up opposition to the revolution, but their principal impact was to reinforce a determination in France to see the revolution succeed.
In June 1791, Louis attempted to 
escape, but was intercepted near the border with the Low Countries and brought back to Paris to the jeers of the increasingly violent, politicized common folk, the sans-culottes, their name a reference to their striped, baggy trousers. There was an increasingly hostile stand-off between political factions in Paris, such as the Girondins and more extremist Jacobins, which attracted the support of the sans-culottes,  
and the French government.
An external threat
Whatever the obvious instability, progress toward a new social order was being made. In September 1791, a constitutional monarchy was proclaimed. Similarly, the church’s privileged position was forcibly ended, though this, too, provoked lasting upheaval and violence. Equally critically, the freedom of  the press was asserted. 
At the same time, revolutionary 
France faced an external threat from Austria and Prussia, both determined to reassert the primacy of hereditary monarchy and to forestall revolutionary tendencies  in their own countries. In April 1792, France declared war on both, a war that would continue, in different guises, for 23 years. By August, the combined Austrian and Prussian forces were within 100 miles (160km) of Paris.
A kind of hysteria gripped the 
city. A mob stormed the Tuileries, where the royal family was held, slaughtering its Swiss Guards. The following month, a further round of killings, the September Massacres, was unleashed against anyone suspected of royalist sympathies. September 1792 also marked the establishment of the directly elected National Convention and of the First French Republic. Almost THE STORMING OF THE BASTILLE
Louis XVI was executed in 1793. 
Using the guillotine as the only means of execution for all people—royals and paupers alike—was meant to reinforce the revolutionary principle of equality.its first act was to put Louis XVI on 
trial as a traitor. In January 1793, he was executed, an early victim of the guillotine, championed as a humane and egalitarian means of death.
The sense of crisis continued to 
grow. In April 1793, the Committee of Public Safety was created to safe-guard the revolution. For a year or more, under the chairmanship of  
a provincial lawyer, Maximilien Robespierre, the most influential  
of the now-dominant Jacobins,  
it would effectively become the government of France. Its impact  
on France, however short-lived, was devastating. This was the Terror. Counter-revolutionary movements across the country were ruthlessly suppressed, most obviously in the Vendée region of the southwest, where up to 300,000 died. Churches proved particularly rich targets. The Terror’s victims were less likely to be remaining aristocrats and more anyone Robespierre suspected of impure thoughts, including almost all of his political opponents.So, legislators, place Terror  
on the order of the day!…  
The blade of the law should 
hover over all the guilty.

Robespierre’s single-minded pursuit of revolutionary purity reached an improbable climax with his creation in 1794 of a new religion, the Cult of the Supreme Being. It was intended as a focus of, and spur to, patriotic and revolutionary virtues, the superstition of the Catholic Church replaced by a belief dedicated to reason celebrating the natural laws of the universe. The megalomania it suggested contributed significantly to his sudden downfall, and at the end of July 1794, Robespierre was put to the guillotine.
Order restored
With the end of the killings—more particularly with the establishment of yet another government, the Directory, at the end of 1795—order of a sort was restored. Tellingly,  it was achieved in part by the Directory’s willingness to use force against the Paris mob, ordered by Napoleon Bonaparte, then a young general in the revolutionary army. 
Furthermore, France’s armies, 
boosted by mass conscription, were reversing early defeats, apparently poised to carry the revolution into new territories. Emboldened, France reinforced its assertion of what it claimed were its “natural frontiers” on the Rhine, which in reality meant an audacious extension of French rule into Germany. By 1797, it had inflicted crushing defeats over Austria in the Low Countries and in northern Italy. France was ready to re-assert what it saw as  
its natural primacy in Europe.
Historical significance
Whatever the importance of the French Revolution, it remains the subject of continuing and intense historical debate. Its notional goals were clear: the ending of repressive monarchy and entrenched privilege; the establishment of representative government; and the championing of universal rights. But the reality was confused and often violent. 
Furthermore, by 1804 Napoleon 
had effectively swapped one form  of absolutism for his own, albeit one vastly more effective than any France had known since Louis XIV. Yet the revolution’s consequences reverberated well into the 20th century. It remains a pivotal moment in the belief that freedom should underpin the civilized world.

A continent reshaped
During the Revolutionary Wars, France had established sister republics in northern Italy and the Low Countries; under Napoleon, many of these were reformed into kingdoms, whose monarchs came from the Emperor’s family. States across Germany were carved up, at the expense of Prussia, to become a French puppet state, while the 800-year-old Holy Roman Empire was abolished. From 1807, much of Poland was controlled by the French as the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. These were states recast on French lines: clerical power was reduced, serfdom abolished, and aristocratic privilege ended. But such reforms provoked inevitable resentments.
Napoleon’s conquests were the 
result not just of military genius  but also of greatly enlarged French armies. Conscription, introduced  in 1793, swelled the French army from 160,000 men to 1.5 million. Only Britain, protected by the English Channel, remained undefeated, its position as the world’s leading maritime power underscored by victory at Trafalgar, off southern Spain, in 1805. But maritime muscle alone was not enough to beat Napoleon. Britain’s most significant role was financing the endlessly shifting alliances confronting the French.
In response, Napoleon imposed 
the Continental System, which forbade trade between continental Europe and Britain. However, Portugal and Russia continued  to trade with Britain, prompting Napoleonic invasions in 1807  and 1812 respectively. 
Resistance to Napoleonic rule 
was mounting; the Spanish began a brutal guerrilla war that drained French resources and came to be referred to by Napoleon as the “Spanish ulcer.”
The final defeat
Napoleon had bred a sense of French invincibility, and this made his eventual defeat all the more traumatic for the nation. Of the 450,000 men he led against Russia in 1812, barely 40,000 survived. 
Napoleon had overreached 
himself. At Leipzig, Germany, in 1813, outnumbered three to one by forces from Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Sweden, he suffered his first major defeat. By Waterloo, his forces had recovered slightly, and the ratio was only two to one, but Napoleon’s military genius failed to redress the balance and his imperial ambition ended in the Waterloo mud.

Simón Bolívar 
Born in Caracas, Venezuela,  
in 1783, Simón Bolívar came 
from one of the oldest and wealthiest noble families in the city. His education was completed in Europe, where he absorbed the republican ideals of the American and French revolutions. The idea  
of independence for Hispanic America accordingly took  
root in his imagination. 
His revolutionary career 
began with an abortive uprising in Caracas in 1810. In 1814, the charismatic Bolívar declared himself “liberator” and head of state of the new republic of Venezuela. In 1817, he staged a daring invasion  
of Colombia and went on to complete the conquests of Ecuador and Peru in 1824. Bolívar’s dream was to unite all of South America—except Argentina, Brazil, and Chile—  
in a single great republic. However, his dictatorial tendencies and the brutality  
of his armies eventually led  
to dissent and the fracturing of Gran Colombia in 1830,  
the year of his death.Indians, black people, and those of 
mixed race—that were never likely to produce coherent political wholes. Plagued by bitter disputes, the short-lived republic of Gran Colombia would break up in 1830. 
Brazilian independence 
Though partly influenced by the liberal doctrines of the American and French revolutions, the drive  
to independence in South America was seldom the product of a desire for social justice or representative government. Aside from two abortive Mexican revolutions in 1810 and 1813, it was a struggle for supremacy between ruling elites, none of which had much interest in the kind of social change—society recast on liberal principles—that underpinned the French Revolution. That said, this drive was also significantly affected by the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon’s invasion of Portugal in 1807 forced the Portuguese king, João VI, and his court to flee to safety in its Brazilian colony. João remained there even after the fall of Napoleon in 1815, returning to Portugal only in 1821. However, his son and heir, Pedro, stayed in Brazil.
As in Spain’s Latin American 
colonies, Brazil was dominated by  a land-owning elite, a great many  of whom, over many generations, had been born in South America.

They came to resent the fact that 
ultimate authority was exercised  by a distant monarchy, and saw no reason why they should submit to it.
There are clear parallels with 
the American Revolution. But  while in North America it was  the fundamental liberties of free-born men that were disputed, in Brazil the issue was narrower— it was simply a question of who would govern.
In 1822, to protect the interests 
of the native-born elite, Pedro declared Brazil an independent constitutional monarchy and himself its emperor. This was a revolution only in the sense that it produced Brazilian independence  
in the interests of those already ruling it. One of the more obvious consequences was that, with no change to the social or economic order, slavery remained legal  in Brazil until 1888, later than anywhere else in the Western world.
Governing Spain’s colonies
In Spain’s colonies, the drive for independence stemmed partly  from the desire of the native-born ruling class—the creoles—to assert their interests, not least in the face of Spain’s restrictive control of South American trade and punitive taxation policies, both to the disadvantage of the colonies. In  the short term, however, it was a reaction to Napoleon’s invasion of Spain in 1808 and his deposition of the Spanish king, Ferdinand VII, in favor of Napoleon’s brother, Joseph. In effect, Spain’s colonies no longer had a legitimate ruler of their own, so it was their plain duty to become rulers themselves, at least until the monarchy could be restored. 
While South American liberals 
saw Joseph as the harbinger of a new, more just social order in place of the absolutism of Ferdinand VII, monarchists in the colonies saw any such liberalizing tendencies  as inherently destabilizing. The seeds of internal conflict were being sown. 
Social revolution in Mexico
At the time, Mexico, which was known as the Vice-Royalty of  New Spain, encompassed an immense area that extended  almost from present-day Wyoming to Panama and that included  most of Texas. Events there took  a different turn. In 1810, a priest, BOLÍVAR ESTABLISHES GRAN COLOMBIA
Pedro I of Brazil , whose coronation  
is illustrated in this painting by 
Jean-Baptiste Debret, was the son  of the king of Portugal. He had been  left in Brazil to rule as regent.
Miguel Hidalgo, appalled at the 
obvious inequalities of Mexico,  led a popular revolution that  ended the following year in its brutal suppression and Hidalgo’s execution. Another popular uprising led by a second Catholic priest, José Morelos, between  1813 and 1815 was similarly put down. When, in 1821, Mexico  did gain independence, it was by force against more or less token Spanish resistance, and under the leadership of Augustín de Iturbide, a Mexican general who proclaimed himself emperor of Mexico the following year. His rule lasted less than a year. By 1838, Mexico had lost all its Central American territories, and by 1848, it had lost all its North American territories.

Events in Spanish South America—which included the triple Vice-Royalties of New Granada, Peru, and Rio de la Plata—followed a very different course. The key figure here was Simón Bolívar. Born in modern-

aristocratic, and highly educated. He had visited Europe several times and was an enthusiastic supporter of modern nation-building on the model established by the French Revolution. He believed, in particular, that the diverse peoples and interests of South America could be brought together by the assertion of a shared South American identity, expressed by the creation of a vast new South American state. This was to be Gran Colombia, which embraced an immense area of northern South America, essentially the modern states of Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama.
Bolívar’s vision of an 
independent South America consistently fell foul of a series  of political realities.

aristocratic, and highly educated. He had visited Europe several times and was an enthusiastic supporter of modern nation-building on the model established by the French Revolution. He believed, in particular, that the diverse peoples and interests of South America could be brought together by the assertion of a shared South American identity, expressed by the creation of a vast new South American state. This was to be Gran Colombia, which embraced an immense area of northern South America, essentially the modern states of Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama.
Bolívar’s vision of an 
independent South America consistently fell foul of a series  of political realities.

On September 15, 1830, the 
world’s first commercial passenger rail service to 
be powered by a steam engine—George Stephenson’s Rocket — 
was opened. This was the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which was 35 miles (56km) long and  served by locomotives, also designed by Stephenson, that  
were capable of reaching speeds approaching 30 mph (48km/h). 
Stephenson’s Rocket  symbolized 
what remains the key development in world history over the past  250 years: the transformation from  an agricultural society that relied on windmills, watermills, horses, and other beasts of burden, to an industrial one, in which steam engines were capable of generating reliable power on a scale that was previously unimaginable.
The background
The industrialization process that started in Britain around the mid- to late 18th century was initiated  by the scientific revolution in Europe in the late 17th century. Of similar importance were financial changes pioneered in the Netherlands, then STEPHENSON’S ROCKET  ENTERS SERVICE

The Industrial Revolution
BEFORE
1776  Adam Smith’s The 
Wealth of Nations  is published.
1781  Watts’s first rotating 
steam engine is invented; the world’s first iron bridge is built at Coalbrookdale, England.
1805  The Grand Junction 
Canal, between Birmingham 
and London, is completed.
1825  The world’s first 
commercial steam-powered 
railway, linking Stockton and Darlington, opens.
AFTER
1855  The Bessemer furnace  
is introduced.
1869  The first transcontinental 
railroad is completed in the US.1885  The first practical petrol- 
driven internal-combustion 
engine is installed in a motor vehicle, in Germany. A scientific revolution  in the West creates a sense that the

imported to Britain: more readily 
available credit helped boost entrepreneurial activities. It had never been easier for members of the increasingly wealthy middle class, looking for ways to invest their money, to support new inventions and technologies.
A third factor was an agricultural 
revolution, which began in the Netherlands and Britain, where farmers realized that crop rotation made it unnecessary to leave land fallow every third year. In both of these countries, land reclamation increased the acreage available  
US_220-225_Stephensons-Rocket.indd   222 15/02/2016   16:43223
for farming. Crop yields were thus boosted, just as selective breeding produced larger and more profitable domesticated animals—sources  of food and wool alike. With any likelihood of famine now receding, the population of Britain grew, between 1750 and 1800, from 6.5 million to over 9 million. This,  in turn, meant new markets and  an expanded workforce.
Finally, in Britain, an improved 
transport network allowed goods, produced on an ever-larger scale,  to be transported faster and more reliably. Between 1760 and 1800,  as many as 4,250 miles (6,840km)  of canals were built in England. 
Thinkers sought to understand 
the impulses behind these societal changes. The publication in 1776  of The Wealth of Nations by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith underpinned what was becoming known as political economy, and the central role of the profit motive and of competition in increasing efficiencies and lowering prices.
This economic transformation  
also contributed to and was, in turn, boosted by the emergence  of global markets—a consequence  of burgeoning European colonial empires, which offered greater  access to raw materials and also provided markets for finished goods. A better-mapped world,  and improvements in ship  types and position-finding at  sea, also facilitated global trade.
Steam power
The overriding force behind the economic transformation, though, was the development of the steam engine. In an astonishingly short time, it would revolutionize Britain, making it the world’s first industrial power, and ultimately transform the world. Even so, it might never have had its dramatic global impact had Britain not had huge reserves of the fuel needed to make it work: coal.  The replacement of wood as the prime source of fuel was critical to industrial development. In exactly the same way, the development of coke (processed coal that burns at much higher temperatures than coal) at the beginning of the 18th century would make the production of iron—the indispensable core material of the new technologies—faster and simpler.
Steam engines of varying 
degrees of reliability had been developed as early as 1712, when Thomas Newcomen built an “atmospheric engine.” But it was only with James Watts’s first rotating steam engine in 1781 that the extraordinary potential of machine

power became clear. The earliest 
steam engines had been used mainly as pumps. Watts’s rotating engine, on the other hand, could power machinery. The engineering company he and Matthew Boulton established in Birmingham in 1775 produced over 500 steam engines.
When Watts’s patents expired  
in 1800, others started producing their own steam engines. The textile industries in the northwest benefited in particular from the increased availability of steam power, and large-scale, almost entirely mechanized, factory production soon replaced small, home-based manufacturing. By 1835, there were more than 120,000 power looms in textile mills. No longer dependent on rivers as power sources, factories could be built anywhere, and they came to be concentrated in towns in the north and Midlands of England that rapidly grew into major industrial centers as the century progressed. 
Social changes
Huge numbers of workers were drawn to these new cities, which became synonymous with poor living and working conditions for the workforce, many of whom were children. This influx led to the creation of an urban underclass. It took a long time before the workers saw any improvement in their lives, and the realization that they should share in the rewards of this social and economic transformation, rather than simply be exploited as mere drudges, came very slowly. In the meantime, however, the increasingly wealthy factory owners emerged as a significant political voice.
The wider world
As late as 1860, Britain was, by some way, still the world’s leading industrial and mercantile power, but other Western nations were quick to see how they too could benefit. In continental Europe, industrialization was initially uncertain, inhibited by the kind of political instability Britain had managed to avoid, such as the revolutions of 1848. Later, the pace of its development would rival Britain’s. In 1840, Germany and France each had around 300 miles (480km) of railway lines; in 1870, both had 10,000 miles (16,000km). Similarly, pig-iron output from each rose from about 125,000 tons in 1840 to 1 million in 1870.STEPHENSON’S ROCKET  ENTERS SERVICE
However, the most startling developments came in the United States, where there were around 3,300 miles (5,300km) of railway  in 1840, almost all in the northeast. By 1860, this had increased to 32,000 miles (51,500km), and by 1900 it had soared to 193,000 miles 
Isambard Kingdom 
BrunelNo figure better encapsulates  
the determination, ambition, and 
vision that drove the first phase of the Industrial Revolution in Britain than the prodigiously hard-working Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806–59). He was responsible for an extraordinary series of firsts: the world’s longest bridge (the Clifton Suspension Bridge), the world’s longest tunnel (Box Tunnel in Wiltshire), and the world’s largest ship (the Great Eastern ). In 1827, still only 21, he 
was appointed chief engineer of the Thames Tunnel. In 1833, he became engineer to the newly formed Great Western Railway, which by 1841 linked London directly with Bristol, whose docks he had rebuilt from 1832. Believing it should be possible to travel directly from London to New York, Brunel also designed the world’s first practical ocean-  
going steamship, the Great Western . He followed this with 
the screw-driven iron-built Great Britain . Despite his great vision, 
delays and cost overruns dogged many of Brunel’s projects, but his works include some of the grandest feats of engineering the world had yet seen.The Bessemer process , devised by 
the English engineer of the same name 
to convert iron into steel, improved the efficiency of all industries—from transport to the military.

(310,600km) of rail track. The 
production of pig iron rose similarly: in 1810, it was a little less than 100,000 tons a year; in 1850, it was approaching 700,000 tons; in 1900, it was over 13 million. 
The role of steel
By about 1870, in both Europe  and the United States, a second wave of industrialization began,  in which oil, chemicals, electricity, and steel became increasingly important. The production of steel had been transformed after 1855, when English engineer Henry Bessemer devised a way to make the metal lighter, stronger, and more versatile; from that point forward, steel would prove the linchpin for industry. In 1870,  total world steel production was 540,000 tons, but within  25 years it had risen to 14 million tons, and railways, armament production, and the shipbuilding industry all benefited from its  ready availability.
While Germany was beginning 
to threaten Britain’s industrial preeminent position in Europe, quadrupling its industrial output between 1870 and 1914, the United States was rapidly becoming the world’s largest industrial power.  In 1880, Britain was still producing  more steel than the United States, but by 1900 the United States was producing more steel than Britain and Germany together.
At the same time, steam-
powered ships were also being introduced. Sailing times, no longer dependent on the vagaries of the wind, became more controllable, and journey times were shortened. The ships were significantly larger, too. While the largest wooden ships rarely exceeded 200ft (60m) in length, the Great Eastern , launched 
in 1858, was 689ft (210m) long. Total world steamship tonnage in 1870 was 1.4 million. By 1910, it  had reached 19 million.
Winners and losers
The benefits of industrialization were unevenly spread. Southern Europe was slow to react to it, and Russia also struggled to catch up. The Chinese and Indian empires proved unwilling or unable to industrialize, Latin America did so only intermittently, and Africa  was dominated by technologically superior powers. By contrast,  after 1868, Japan’s single-minded pursuit of industrialization made  it a world power. 
Industrialization also made 
possible a new kind of warfare, one capable of bringing death on a scale CHANGING SOCIETIES
never seen before. An enduring irony of industrialization is that the nations that benefited most from it turned it against themselves in two world wars, deploying weapons of extraordinarily destructive power.
The Industrial Revolution laid 
the foundations for the modern world. Fueled by an enormous sense of new possibilities, in  some places it raised living standards across all sections of society in ways unimaginable  in earlier ages. However, in the wealthy West, it also produced  a sense that material superiority was equivalent to a kind of moral superiority, one that not merely made it possible for the West to dominate the world, but demanded that it do so.

The passing in 1807 of the 
Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves in the United 
States and the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act in Britain marked  
a radical shift in Western thinking. Even as late as the 1780s, the trade in slaves was still regarded as a “natural” economic activity. Both the newly created United States, “conceived in liberty,” and the European colonies in the Caribbean depended on slave labor that was relatively easily obtained in West Africa. Portuguese-ruled Brazil was even more dependent on slaves.

position. Not only had slavery never 
been legal there—a point critically reinforced in 1772 in what was called the Somersett case, which ruled that any slave was free once on British soil—but Britons prided themselves on their robust defense of such fundamental freedoms. Even so, Britain was also, by  some margin, the West’s leading slave-trading nation. It was this contradiction that offended both religious and Enlightenment political sensibilities alike.
Global changes
To a number of high-minded and unusually active campaigners  such as William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson, the abolition of slavery became an imperative. A remarkably effective campaign was launched that, despite entrenched opposition, rapidly won wide public and parliamentary support. For much of the 19th century, the Royal Navy would be at the forefront of the campaign to intercept those still engaged in slave trading. 
While Britain took the lead,  
the movement had important supporters elsewhere. The revolutionary French National Convention outlawed slavery in 1794 (though this would partially  be overturned by Napoleon in 1802). Brazil aside, where slavery would not be banned until 1888, all the newly independent states that emerged in Latin America after 1810 likewise outlawed slavery.
It wasn’t until 1833 that slavery 
itself, as opposed to the trade, was made illegal in the British Empire. Whatever the efforts of a new set of campaigners, not least Elizabeth Heyrick, the motive was not entirely humanitarian. The Haitian slave revolt, which began in 1791 and led to the emergence of an independent Haiti in 1804, had left the West uncomfortably aware that any such uprisings might prove difficult to suppress. A slave revolt in British-ruled Jamaica in 1831 reinforced the point: in the longer term, freeing slaves might prove less trouble than enslaving them.
The United States, forward-
looking and expansive, remained the great troubling sore. The more abolitionists in its industrializing northern states denounced slavery, the more its southern states, their agrarian economies dependent on slave labor, were determined to retain it. It would take a four-year civil war and 670,000 dead to  settle the question. 
■The Haitian Revolt
Few uprisings illustrate the 
contradictions of the revolutions that swept across the late 18th- century Western world better than that in Haiti (1791–1804). This French Caribbean colony, known as St. Domingue, owed its enormous prosperity to slave labor. The revolt, led by a freed slave, Toussaint L’Ouverture, was inspired by the American and French revolutions. Yet neither country supported it:  
The US was concerned it might inspire similar revolts in its slave states; France, despite its pledge to abolish slavery, was wary of the damage to its trade. Spain, which ruled the eastern half of the island, also opposed it, as did Britain, fearing it would spread to its own colonies. Even the South American colonies seeking independence refused to back it, fearful of its impact among their substantial slave populations. Yet the occasional combined resources of all these states were unable to quell the uprising. This was the only slave revolt to result in the emergence of an independent state.The state of slavery is 
repugnant to the principles of 
the British constitution and

position. Not only had slavery never 
been legal there—a point critically reinforced in 1772 in what was called the Somersett case, which ruled that any slave was free once on British soil—but Britons prided themselves on their robust defense of such fundamental freedoms. Even so, Britain was also, by  some margin, the West’s leading slave-trading nation. It was this contradiction that offended both religious and Enlightenment political sensibilities alike.
Global changes
To a number of high-minded and unusually active campaigners  such as William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson, the abolition of slavery became an imperative. A remarkably effective campaign was launched that, despite entrenched opposition, rapidly won wide public and parliamentary support. For much of the 19th century, the Royal Navy would be at the forefront of the campaign to intercept those still engaged in slave trading. 
While Britain took the lead,  
the movement had important supporters elsewhere. The revolutionary French National Convention outlawed slavery in 1794 (though this would partially  be overturned by Napoleon in 1802). Brazil aside, where slavery would not be banned until 1888, all the newly independent states that emerged in Latin America after 1810 likewise outlawed slavery.
It wasn’t until 1833 that slavery 
itself, as opposed to the trade, was made illegal in the British Empire. Whatever the efforts of a new set of campaigners, not least Elizabeth Heyrick, the motive was not entirely humanitarian. The Haitian slave revolt, which began in 1791 and led to the emergence of an independent Haiti in 1804, had left the West uncomfortably aware that any such uprisings might prove difficult to suppress. A slave revolt in British-ruled Jamaica in 1831 reinforced the point: in the longer term, freeing slaves might prove less trouble than enslaving them.
The United States, forward-
looking and expansive, remained the great troubling sore. The more abolitionists in its industrializing northern states denounced slavery, the more its southern states, their agrarian economies dependent on slave labor, were determined to retain it. It would take a four-year civil war and 670,000 dead to  settle the question. 
■The Haitian Revolt
Few uprisings illustrate the 
contradictions of the revolutions that swept across the late 18th- century Western world better than that in Haiti (1791–1804). This French Caribbean colony, known as St. Domingue, owed its enormous prosperity to slave labor. The revolt, led by a freed slave, Toussaint L’Ouverture, was inspired by the American and French revolutions. Yet neither country supported it:  
The US was concerned it might inspire similar revolts in its slave states; France, despite its pledge to abolish slavery, was wary of the damage to its trade. Spain, which ruled the eastern half of the island, also opposed it, as did Britain, fearing it would spread to its own colonies. Even the South American colonies seeking independence refused to back it, fearful of its impact among their substantial slave populations. Yet the occasional combined resources of all these states were unable to quell the uprising. This was the only slave revolt to result in the emergence of an independent state.The state of slavery is 
repugnant to the principles of 
the British constitution and  
of the Christian religion.

 SOCIETY WAS CUT IN TWO
 THE 1848 REVOLUTIONS 
On February 24, 1848, Louis-
Philippe of France, the “Citizen King,” abdicated 
as Paris erupted in protest at the government’s refusals to initiate  reforms—demanded by the middle and working classes alike—to introduce political liberalization and to end inequalities. In his place, a Second Republic was declared. In June, fearful that one authoritarian government had  been exchanged for another, the Parisian working classes rose  again, but the uprising was savagely put down. In December, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte—nephew  of Napoleon, who had died in  1821—was elected president. In 1851, he staged a coup, and the following year he was proclaimed  
as Emperor Napoleon III.
France was plagued by political 
instability throughout the 19th century. The 1848 revolution came after a similar upheaval in 1830, and it would be followed by an  even more violent uprising 23 years later, in 1871. 
The spark for the revolution  
of 1848 was a famine during  
the previous two winters. This provoked widespread unrest  
among the dispossessed urban poor, along with demands from a burgeoning bourgeoisie for liberal political reforms. The ardor of  
the revolution sparked similar revolts across continental Europe, most obviously in the German Confederation, in multi-ethnic Austria, and in Italy. Every single revolt was subdued, in most instances by force.
The rise of socialism
Before and after the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815, and concerned about citizens rising up elsewhere, Europe’s statesmen met in Vienna to try to create a political order that would stifle such an occurrence. 
This painting by Horace Vernet shows 
the barricades at Rue Soufflot, Paris. In June 1848, fighting erupted between the liberal republican government and Parisian workers seeking social reform. IN CONTEXT

The ceremonial opening, on 
November 17, 1869, of the Suez Canal, linking the 
Mediterranean and the Red seas, was an emphatic declaration of European—specifically, French – technological and financial  means. It was also a significant illustration of a rapidly emerging and increasingly interdependent global economy, featuring goods from all parts of the world being traded on an ever-larger scale.  This was a process dominated by Europe’s colonial powers and the United States, overwhelmingly its  principal beneficiaries. It was simultaneously a further boost  to Europe’s imperial ambitions.
The Suez Canal reduced the 
sailing route between London and Bombay by 41 percent, and the route between London and Hong Kong by 26 percent. The impact  on trade was plain to see. However, reduced sailing times also greatly simplified the defense of India and its crucial markets, Britain’s key imperial goal. By the end of the 19th century, trade in the Indian Ocean, protected by no fewer than 21 Royal Navy bases, had become THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SUEZ CANAL

It, too, dramatically reduced sailing times, shortening the Liverpool to San Francisco route by 42 percent, and the New York to San Francisco route by 60 percent.
US involvement
The fact that the United States  took over the construction of the Panama Canal underlines a crucial shift in US attitudes: they were committing not just to expanding trade but also to advancing US overseas interests. This had begun in 1898, when the US itself became a colonial power, taking over the Philippines from Spain.

the same spirit. A remarkable  
4,600 miles (7,400km) long and spanning seven time zones, it remains the longest continuous railway in the world. It played a key role not just in the settlement of Russia’s vast Siberian territories, but in Russia’s encroachment on parts of northern China, too. 
The impact of the telegraph  
was just as significant, allowing messages to be communicated along electrical lines. Samuel Morse devised the system in the United States in the 1830s, and the first telegraph line was inaugurated in May 1844. Within a decade, there were 20,000 miles (32,200km)  of telegraph cable in the US. 
The first telegraph cable across 
the Atlantic, laid in 1858, worked for only two weeks. But by 1866, a new cable had been installed, capable of transmitting 120 words per minute. By 1870, a telegraph link had been established between London and Bombay; this was then extended to Australia in 1872 and New Zealand in 1876. By 1902, the United States was linked to Hawaii. This was the first near-instant international communications system.The Great Eastern
The ship responsible for laying the transatlantic cable in 1866 was the Great Eastern , designed by the 
most visionary engineer of the  first phase of the Industrial Revolution, Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Designed to carry 4,000 passengers from England to Australia non-stop (and to return  to England without refueling),  the ship was overly ambitious in concept and a commercial failure. 
However, it was indicative  
of a trend toward larger, faster,  and safer ships. Unlike the Great Eastern , which was built of iron, 
later, steel-built, propeller-driven ships would prove more versatile. Their introduction coincided with the development of more powerful and efficient steam engines.
Steamships and trade
The decline of the sailing ship further transformed imperial  trade. One notable result was  the introduction of a series of  ever-larger passenger ships. The transatlantic route saw the most obvious developments. In 1874, the British steamer Britannic , capable 
of generating 5,500 horsepower,  set a new east–west Atlantic  record of just under eight days.  In 1909, the Mauretania , which 
generated 70,000 horsepower and carried over 2,000 passengers,  set a new record of four days  and 10 hours, cruising at an average speed of 26 knots, or  30mph (48km/h).
New types of merchant ships— 
mainly refrigerated vessels—were also being built. Such developments show how technology helped drive trade, making it possible to reach global markets. The cattle and sheep farms in South America (especially Argentina), Australia, and New Zealand were growing  THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SUEZ CANAL

Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, UK, was the

populations. At the same time,  the number of people in Europe was also increasing—for example, Britain swelled from 28 million  to 35 million between 1850 and 1880. Feeding and clothing the populations were important priorities. Wool could be easily transported, but lamb and beef could not be shipped because it would rot en route—until 1877, when 80 tons of frozen beef  were shipped from Argentina to France on board the world’s first refrigerated ship. By 1881, regular shipments of frozen meat were traveling between Australia and Britain. The first shipment of  lamb from New Zealand was made the following year. There was a  vast increase in the export of  meat from all three countries— New Zealand, for example, exported 2.3 million frozen sheep  in 1895, 3.3 million in 1900, and 5.8 million in 1910.
The demand for cotton—above 
all in the great textile mills of the northwest of England, which by 1850 were producing up to 50 percent  
of the world’s cloth—led to an enormous surge in cotton growing. In the southern states of the US, raw cotton production increased from Although gold and silver are

However, the ploy failed, since Britain merely increased its imports of raw cotton from India. After weaving the cotton, it then exported it back to India at substantial profits.Global finance
This complex trading network could not have grown without developments in banking and financing. Throughout the late  
19th century, new banks were established, their capital used  
to support enterprises across  
the world. At the same time, London emerged as the world’s financial capital. By the end of  CHANGING SOCIETIES
the 19th century, the British  
pound sterling, its value pegged  
at 113 grains of gold, was the currency against which all others were measured. 
Western overseas investments 
dramatically increased. By 1914, the United States had overseas assets worth $3.5 billion, Germany $6 billion, France $8 billion, and Britain almost $20 billion. Between them, North America and northern Europe’s share of world income  in 1860 was about $4.3 billion a year, 35 percent of the world’s  total. In 1914, it was $18.5 billion,  60 percent of the world’s total. 
Patterns of imperialism varied 
over the 19th century. In the  British Empire, for example, clear and increasing distinctions were drawn between those colonies—  
in Africa and Asia, above all—whose native populations were governed by Europeans, and  
those—such as Canada, South Africa, Australia, and New  
Zealand—deemed capable of  
self-government. By 1907, all four had been granted dominion status. It was not a privilege extended  to a single British African colony  or to India. 
■ 
The Great Mineral Rush
The search for new sources of 
minerals, both precious and industrial, reached new heights toward the close of the 19th century. Discoveries of diamonds and gold in the US, Canada, Australia, and—most significantly of all—South Africa sparked a frenzy of development. Diamonds were discovered in South Africa’s Orange Free State in 1867, and gold in the Transvaal in 1886. Both were independent Boer republics, established by the descendants of the original  Dutch settlers of what had become the British Cape Colony. Their heightened economic importance reinforced Britain’s determination to annex them, which they could do only after  
the bitter Boer War (1899– 1902), which stretched Britain’s military resources to their  limits. The exploitation, both before and after the conflict,  
of the mineral resources of  what in 1910 became the Union  
of South Africa by armies of underpaid black workers would later prove to be critical in the institutionalizing of Apartheid.
Working conditions in South 
Africa’s gold mines were harsh, and the work force—mainly young black men—was exploited and underpaid. The Suez Canal greatly shortened travel times—  
and eased journeys—between parts of the  British Empire, such  as England and India.  That distance of 10,800 nautical miles was  cut by more than  40 percent, to just  6,200 nautical miles.

the 19th century, the British  
pound sterling, its value pegged  
at 113 grains of gold, was the currency against which all others were measured. 
Western overseas investments 
dramatically increased. By 1914, the United States had overseas assets worth $3.5 billion, Germany $6 billion, France $8 billion, and Britain almost $20 billion. Between them, North America and northern Europe’s share of world income  in 1860 was about $4.3 billion a year, 35 percent of the world’s  total. In 1914, it was $18.5 billion,  60 percent of the world’s total. 
Patterns of imperialism varied 
over the 19th century. In the  British Empire, for example, clear and increasing distinctions were drawn between those colonies—  
in Africa and Asia, above all—whose native populations were governed by Europeans, and  
those—such as Canada, South Africa, Australia, and New  
Zealand—deemed capable of  
self-government. By 1907, all four had been granted dominion status. It was not a privilege extended  to a single British African colony  or to India.

The Great Mineral Rush
The search for new sources of 
minerals, both precious and industrial, reached new heights toward the close of the 19th century. Discoveries of diamonds and gold in the US, Canada, Australia, and—most significantly of all—South Africa sparked a frenzy of development. Diamonds were discovered in South Africa’s Orange Free State in 1867, and gold in the Transvaal in 1886. Both were independent Boer republics, established by the descendants of the original  Dutch settlers of what had become the British Cape Colony. Their heightened economic importance reinforced Britain’s determination to annex them, which they could do only after  
the bitter Boer War (1899– 1902), which stretched Britain’s military resources to their  limits. The exploitation, both before and after the conflict,  
of the mineral resources of  what in 1910 became the Union  
of South Africa by armies of underpaid black workers would later prove to be critical in the institutionalizing of Apartheid.
Working conditions in South 
Africa’s gold mines were harsh, and the work force—mainly young black men—was exploited and underpaid. The Suez Canal greatly shortened travel times—  
and eased journeys—between parts of the  British Empire, such  as England and India.  That distance of 10,800 nautical miles was  cut by more than  40 percent, to just  6,200 nautical miles.London

Perhaps the most important 
scientist of the 19th century, Charles Darwin originally 
intended to follow his father into medicine and was subsequently sent to Cambridge to train as an Anglican cleric. Endlessly curious, he was interested in almost any scientific question.The publication of his book On the Origin of Species (1859) introduced a new scientific understanding of what gradually came to be known as evolution. In the book, Darwin asked a fundamental question. The world teems with plant and animal life: where and what had it come from? How had it been created?IN CONTEXT

Darwin was far from the first to 
propose that a process of change over vast periods had produced this diversity, but he was the first to suggest an explanatory theme, which he called “natural selection”. 
Natural selection
At the heart of Darwin’s idea was his contention that all animal life was derived from a single, common ancestor—that the ancestors of all mammals, humans included, for example, were fish. And in a natural world that was never less than relentlessly violent, only those most able to adapt would survive, in the process evolving into new species.
These views were largely formed 
by the around-the-world voyage he made as the naturalist on the British survey vessel HMS Beagle  between 
1831 and 1836, most of it spent in South America. It would take him 10 years to work up his voluminous notes and to go through all the samples he collected on his voyage. 
Darwin’s book inevitably 
generated controversy, outraging Christian views that the world had been created intact and unchanging by a benevolent deity. Yet however heated the initial debate, quite rapidly there was widespread acceptance of Darwin’s views and a realization that he had made  a decisive contribution to the understanding of the world. In  the process, the status of science generally was immensely boosted. 
The primacy of science
Despite everything, it was possible for Darwinism to be warped. What came to be called “the survival of the fittest” would later prove to be influential in justifying imperialism, racism, and eugenics. 
On the Origin of Species was 
published at a time when a growing understanding of the natural world and rapid technological progress meant scientific study had a greater practical worth than ever before. Darwin was one of the last amateur gentleman scientists in a discipline that was becoming professionalized as society came to view science more highly. Partly as a result of Darwin’s work, but also because of these changing attitudes, science began to have a more central place in public life. By the end of Darwin’s life, continual progress in scientific knowledge had become an almost standard expectation.

 THE EXPEDITION OF THE THOUSAND  (1860)
On May 11, 1860, the Italian 
patriot and guerrilla fighter Giuseppe Garibaldi landed 
in Sicily, then part of the Bourbon-ruled Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, in southern Italy, leading a force of volunteers drawn from across Italy and just over 1,000 strong, hence their name, I Mille  (The Thousand). 
Their goal was to overthrow the Bourbons, but there was much uncertainty as to what government would replace the ruling family.

goal of ending Austrian rule in the north of the country and by the  idea of a united Italy. The desire to form new political entities based on common national elements such as geography and history came to be known as nationalism. 
Reaching a compromise
In 1859, much of Italy had already been united under the state of Piedmont-Sardinia, in the northwest of Italy, a process directed by its shrewd and pragmatic prime minister Camillo Cavour and critically boosted by French military assistance in expelling  the Austrians. 
For Cavour, unification meant 
the creation not of a republican Italy, but of a centralized state under a constitutional monarchy. He believed this was the only way that 
Italy could realize its potential—above all, to press ahead with industrialization and compete with the leading powers of Europe.

Nationalism was furthermore 
characterized by a romantic view  
of the right of peoples to lay claim to their historic destinies and rule themselves: independence. In place of loyalty to an established ruling dynasty, new loyalties to national groups defined by language, culture, history, and self-identity were formulated. The idea of the nation-state became increasingly common, and likewise a belief in the right to national self-determination.
The failure of the revolutions  
of 1848 in central Europe and Italy, intended to advance these very goals, made plain the resolve of Europe’s ruling elites to oppose such initiatives and to preserve the Europe created by the Congress  of Vienna in 1814–15, after the defeat of Napoleon—a Europe of monarchs, multinational empires, and pre-French Revolution frontiers. 
Metternich’s failures
The new Europe was far from stable, and the principal architect of the Congress of Vienna, the Austrian Prince Metternich, would later admit: “I have spent my life in shoring up rotten buildings.” By 1830, Belgium had revolted against the Kingdom of the Netherlands, of which it was a province; the next year, it secured its independence with British support. Similar nationalist uprisings followed in Poland in 1831 and in 1846, both savagely repressed by Russia.
German nationalism 
Rising nationalism had momentous consequences, especially in the various states across Germany.  
The country’s unification under  
the chancellorship of Otto von Bismarck of Prussia in 1871 and  
the declaration of a German empire jolted Europe into a new era. For Bismarck, much as they had been for Cavour, the benefits of unification were clear. It would be the means  
by which a common German nationality could be expressed, allowing the country to fill the need to underline an overarching German character that the philosopher Georg Hegel had identified. It  would also break the dominance of Habsburg Austria over the German-speaking world—in particular,  
to lever the southern Catholic German states, Bavaria above all, away from Austrian influence.
In the interests of building this 
great German state, Bismarck pressed into service a kind of conservative nationalism. The goal was not social or democratic reform to establish a more just or liberal state; it was the creation of a country to challenge the world. German nationalism under Bismarck translated into a determined adoption of industrialization and the creation of ever larger and more efficient armed forces.
And it was military means that 
Bismarck single-mindedly deployed to create this new Germany. He mounted three major campaigns. The first, against Denmark in  1864, saw Prussia subsuming  the southern Danish territories  THE EXPEDITION OF THE THOUSAND

of Schleswig and Holstein, with 
Austrian support. In 1866, Prussian troops routed Austria itself; finally, in 1870–71, an army from across Germany comprehensively and humiliatingly defeated France, toppling Napoleon III’s government, and starving Paris into submission. These military victories underlined a seemingly irresistible German destiny whose logical consequence was a unified German empire under the Prussian king, now emperor, Wilhelm I.
Nationalist aspirations
Nowhere were the conflicting impulses of nationalism more tangled than in the Habsburg Austrian Empire, an immense patchwork of ethnic groups across Central Europe under the nominal rule of Vienna. In 1867, following Austria’s defeat by Prussia the previous year, Hungary was  able to secure almost complete independence from Austria. The “dual-monarchy” that resulted— the Austrian Empire, now the Austro-Hungarian Empire—not

only greatly boosted an assertive 
sense of Hungarian self-identity but also secured Hungary significant territorial concessions from Vienna, notably in Transylvania and Croatia. Yet whatever the continuing tensions between Austria and Hungary, the two warily preferred  
to remain united precisely for fear  
of further nationalist agitations  
from their own splintered ethnic populations. The Hungarians, for example, were notably reluctant to concede the kind of political rights they demanded for themselves to their substantial Slovak, Romanian, and Serb populations. At the same time, waning Ottoman control of the Balkans also encouraged nationalist aspirations—Serbia, for example, had emerged as a more or less independent state as early as 1817. Wallachia and Moldavia, essentially modern Romania, could lay similar claims to independence by 1829. The Greeks, portraying themselves as the legatees of ancient Greek civilization, a role that won them support from liberals across Europe, had secured their independence by 1830 after a nine-year war. 
Both Austria and Russia 
competed to fill the void left by the Ottomans. Austria’s provocative occupation of Bosnia in 1878, which it peremptorily annexed in 1908, would create tensions that led directly to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. The Balkan Wars of 1912–13—in effect a bitter squabble for supremacy between Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece—were further evidence of the destabilizing effect of nationalist-driven state building.CHANGING SOCIETIES
The consequences 
The notion that social justice could be secured by peoples pursuing the right to self-determination would rarely be realized in the 1800s—Vienna would continue to rule over its multi-ethnic empire until its defeat at the end of World War I  in 1918, for example. Likewise,  the people of Poland were  
denied any means of exercising such nationalistic rights to self-determination. And the Jews of Europe remained persistently oppressed, whatever the promise of Zionism from the 1890s to create a Jewish nation in the Holy Land.

which took place between May and November 1857, 
led to scenes that were duplicated across much of north-central  India during the Indian Mutiny  of 1857–58: of British enclaves enduring great suffering at the hands of previously loyal local troops. When the British began to restore order, the retribution was no less severe. The violence from both sides shocked the public and led to immediate calls for reform.
The mutiny began when the 
Indian troops—sepoys—became convinced that the cartridges of their new rifles had been greased with cow and pig fat, offensive to Hindus and Muslims alike. But  its roots lay in the dislocation  that many in India felt at British control—the uprooting of traditional rulers, the apparent threat to local religions, and the aggressive assertion of alien rule.
Britain’s initial response after 
the mutiny was intended to reassure India of Britain’s peaceful intentions toward it, but in reality  it underlined the fact that India was now entirely subservient to Britain, both economically and politically.
As the number of European-
educated Indian elites grew, they would challenge Britain’s rights over the subcontinent. Britain would continue to assert its imperial destiny, but increasingly had to confront the improbability that it could. If there was an enduring truth, it was that British rule in India was never as robust as it seemed.

 THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS (1863)
On November 19, 1863,  
little more than halfway through the American Civil 
War, in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, US President Abraham Lincoln gave what came to be known as the Gettysburg Address. In it, he characterized the Civil War as a struggle both for national unity and to guarantee equality for all people.
Lincoln was talking at the 
dedication of the Soldiers’ National Cemetery, which commemorated the 7,058 soldiers killed at the Battle of Gettysburg, an encounter fought between July 1–3, the same year that had left 27,224 more wounded. Gettysburg had been the bloodiest battle of the American Civil War, as IN CONTEXT

the outnumbered, outgunned, yet improbably successful Southern army led by Robert E. Lee, the Army of Northern Virginia, suffered its first major defeat.
The causes of the war
The American Civil War was not simply a war about slavery; it was  
a war about whether so divisive an issue could be allowed to break up the United States. The United States, as Lincoln said, was a nation “conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,” yet its Southern states had a population of almost 4 million black slaves. Under the constitution of the United States, they were legally owned property. For the abolitionists of the rapidly industrializing north—always  
a minority, but still exceedingly vocal—slavery was morally repugnant and an outrage against their Christian sensibilities. 
However, slavery was not just 
the backbone of the agricultural prosperity of the Southern states;  CHANGING SOCIETIES
The Battle of Gettysburg took place 
in 1863. After three days of fighting  and the death of more than 7,000 soldiers, the Confederate army was forced to retreat.
Abraham Lincoln When he arrived in Washington in 
February 1861 for his presidential inauguration, Abraham Lincoln (1809–65) was widely dismissed  
in political circles as an ignorant, socially awkward backwoodsman. By the time of his assassination just four years later, he had come to dominate America. Lincoln  
had not just won the Civil War, but he had also established himself as a kind of irresistible political oracle. 
Born in a log cabin in Kentucky, 
Lincoln qualified as a lawyer  
by his late 20s. He became an increasingly articulate champion of what would emerge as the anti-slavery Republican party. Despite having no military experience, Lincoln proved  
an increasingly shrewd judge  
of how the Civil War should  
best be fought, actively arguing in favor of General Grant.  
He never lost sight of his  
wider aims: the maintenance  
of American liberties and the essential dignity of humanity. He pushed on with the war  
with unflinching determination, yet he understood precisely what loss of life on the scale  
of the Civil War meant.for slave-owning Southerners, it 
was a right. For them, “liberty” had an additional meaning: the liberty to possess slaves.
The disagreement underlined 
the question over States’ Rights—the extent to which the rights of individual states trumped the authority of the federal, or central, government in Washington. This question repeatedly resurfaced as territories in the west were settled and sought admission to the Union: would they be slave or “free” states?
The 1820 Missouri Compromise 
stated that slavery would be allowed only in new states south of a line extending westward from the southern border of Missouri. It  
was later agreed that the settlers  
of new states should decide for themselves whether theirs would be free or slave states—a decision that was reinforced by the

Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. Since 
both Kansas and Nebraska were to the north of Missouri’s southern border, what followed, in Kansas above all, was a sudden inrush of pro- and anti-slavery settlers, each desperate to prevail. The two sides clashed repeatedly and violently.
The South breaks away
This conflict led to the founding  of a new anti-slavery party, the Republicans, on whose ticket Abraham Lincoln, with practically no support from any slave state, was voted into office in November 1860. Lincoln’s victory prompted the almost immediate decision by South Carolina to secede, to leave the Union. By February, a further six Southern states had broken away, and the seven declared themselves a new nation: the Confederate States of America. By May, when Richmond in Virginia was made the capital of the new country, four more states had joined them. However, five slave states, the so-called Border States, opted to remain within the original Union.
The Confederacy argued that 
the Constitution had been freely adopted, and as such any state could legitimately break away  from the Union if it felt oppressed. As free-born men, the citizens of the South had an “inalienable” right to shape their own destinies, just as the founding fathers had when they rejected the tyranny of British rule. In the minds of many Southerners, the US government was guilty of precisely the same kind of tyranny in seeking to limit these freedoms.
It was a deeply held position. As 
Alexander Stephens, vice-president of the Confederacy, asserted, the cornerstone of this new state “rest[ed] upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery… is his natural and normal condition…”.THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS
As a supreme political operator, Lincoln realized the need to proceed with caution. Initially at any rate, his position was that he sought only to restrict the expansion of slavery while preserving the Union. On  
the second point, Lincoln was immovable; he felt the authority of the federal government overrode that of individual states.
The United States, the only  
fully democratic country on Earth, had been created as what Lincoln called “a great promise to the world,” so ensuring its survival was an absolute moral duty. By the time of his Emancipation Proclamation The United States is born as a beacon of liberty  
in which slavery  is nonetheless permitted.
The industrial Northern 
states  are opposed  to any 
extension of slavery into 
any new states.
The Gettysburg Address is Lincoln’s most 
eloquent attempt to justify the war as the 
means to a more just United States.The Southern states  
increasingly see slavery  
as a key part of their  
agrarian society .
These differences of opinion help spark the Civil War ,  
bringing destruction on an unforeseen scale , with neither  
the North nor the South able to best the other.
The South’s defeat  results in political paralysis   
and institutionalized discrimination  against its  
black population that persists well into the next century .
I cannot raise my hand  
against my birthplace,  
my home, my children.

shows life for black Americans before and after emancipation. Abraham Lincoln is also portrayed.in January 1863, Lincoln felt 
politically secure enough to order the freeing of all Southern slaves. But in the short term, the Civil War was fought to keep this “great promise” intact.
Eventual Northern victory
The outcome of the American Civil War was dictated ultimately by the human and material discrepancies between the North and the South. There were 21 Union states with  a population of 20 million, and 11 Southern states with a population  of 9 million, 4 million of whom were slaves, and therefore not allowed  to bear arms. Despite the fact that by 1864, 44 percent of males in the North between the ages of 18 and 60 were in military service, versus 90 percent in the Southern states, the North was still able to enlist 2.2 million men over the whole war, compared to the South’s 800,000. 
The North was three times 
richer than the South. It had 2.4 miles (3.8km) of railroad to every  
1 mile (1.6km) in the South. Its factories manufactured 10 times more goods. It produced 20 times more iron than the South, 38 times as much coal, and 32 times as many firearms. The only area in which the South exceeded the North was in cotton production, at 24 to 1.
In the face of this superiority,  
the fact that the South was not only able to resist the Union forces for four years but also to come close  
to victory in 1862 and 1863 was a reflection of the Southern soldiers’ profound belief in their cause. It was also the result of its plainly superior generals—the Virginian Robert E. Lee above all. By contrast, at least until the emergence of Ulysses S. Grant and William Sherman as the two leading commanders of the Union forces, the North had been able to muster only a succession  
of timid and inept generals who frittered away the advantages they so abundantly possessed.
Reinvigorated by Grant and 
Sherman, the North prevailed. The razing of Atlanta in September 1864 was followed by Sherman’s “march to the sea” at Savannah, Georgia. Completed in December, it left a 60-mile- (96.5-km-) wide swathe of destruction, deliberately targeting

civilian property. “War is cruelty,” Sherman asserted. “The crueler it is, the sooner it will be over.”
A new freedom
The US Civil War was the world’s first major industrial war, the first to make widespread use of railroads, and the first widely reported in a new kind of popular press. There was concentrated death on a scale never seen before: around 670,000 dead, 50,000 of them civilians, in little more than four years. 
For Abraham Lincoln, the war 
represented what in the Gettysburg Address he called “unfinished business.” The Constitution had  left unresolved the question of  how slavery could exist in a nation “conceived in liberty.” Despite the destruction and the huge death  toll, the war brought a chance  
at “a new birth of freedom.” The  
end of slavery, confirmed by  
the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, represented an opportunity for the US to be recast as a genuinely free land for all its citizens, black and white.

The belief by sometime

of the United States lay in its expansion to the west was boosted immensely by the discovery of  
gold in a river in northern California in January 1848. Even allowing  
for the inevitable difficulties of communication and travel at the time, the find sparked a frenzied reaction. Over the next five years,  
as many as 300,000 “49ers”—a reference to the year in which the influx began in earnest—were drawn to what, in 1850, would become the 31st state of the US. The immediate consequence was both a wild lawlessness in the pursuit of instant riches and the confirmation of America’s Pacific coast as a promised land. The

population of San Francisco, the main point of entry, was hardly 200 in 1846. By 1852, it was more than 30,000, and by 1870, it was 150,000.
A handful, mostly early arrivals, 
made fortunes, while some made modest profits, and most made nothing at all. The California gold rush seemed a national obsession. In reality, it was no more than  an extreme instance of the determination to colonize North America by the United States that was underway long before the gold had been found. By 1803, Vermont, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Ohio had become states. In addition to the annexation of Texas in 1845, a further 13 states had been added by 1848. In the same year, New Mexico and California were also seized from Mexico. 
New technologies
To reach California, the 49ers endured journeys of astonishing hardship, traveling by wagon across the immensities of the Great Plains or by ship around Cape Horn, and sometimes across the Isthmus of Panama. Six months was the expected minimum for these enormous undertakings. 
However, an extraordinary 
resolution to link these vast new territories was being forged, harnessing new technology in pursuit of nation-building on an epic scale. In 1861, the first telegraph line was established between the east and the west coasts. In 1869, the first transcontinental railroad line 
The Battle of the Little Bighorn
Gold was behind the most 
famous confrontation between the new settlers of the west and the native populations: the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876. The US government authorized the settlement of the Black Hills of South Dakota after gold was discovered there. By doing so, however, it broke a treaty with the Sioux of the Great Plains. When, in return, substantial numbers of Sioux and Cheyenne refused to move to reservations, federal cavalry were sent to Montana to round them up. Among them was a troop of 600 under Lieutenant Colonel George Custer. Some 200 of these men, led by Custer himself, discovered the Indian encampment in the Little Bighorn Valley. In just one hour, the combined American Indian warriors, led by Sitting Bull, killed Custer’s entire force.  
Their deaths renewed the government’s determination to force the Sioux and Cheyenne into reservations at any cost.was completed, slashing journey 
times: by 1876, it was possible to travel from New York to California in three and a half days.
Settlers and victims
Immigration was the fuel that powered these transformations, the new lands demanding a vast influx of new settlers. In 1803, the US population stood at 4 million. By 1861, it was 31 million; and by the turn of the century, 76 million. There were inevitable costs to  such rapid growth, and American Indians paid the highest price. Driven off their tribal lands with relentless brutality, their numbers dropped from perhaps as many as 4.5 million to 500,000. Herded into reservations, their traditional way of life destroyed, they were helpless in the face of this seemingly irresistible expansion.

resolution to link these vast new territories was being forged, harnessing new technology in pursuit of nation-building on an epic scale. In 1861, the first telegraph line was established between the east and the west coasts. In 1869, the first transcontinental railroad line 
The Battle of the Little Bighorn
Gold was behind the most 
famous confrontation between the new settlers of the west and the native populations: the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876. The US government authorized the settlement of the Black Hills of South Dakota after gold was discovered there. By doing so, however, it broke a treaty with the Sioux of the Great Plains. When, in return, substantial numbers of Sioux and Cheyenne refused to move to reservations, federal cavalry were sent to Montana to round them up. Among them was a troop of 600 under Lieutenant Colonel George Custer. Some 200 of these men, led by Custer himself, discovered the Indian encampment in the Little Bighorn Valley. In just one hour, the combined American Indian warriors, led by Sitting Bull, killed Custer’s entire force.  
Their deaths renewed the government’s determination to force the Sioux and Cheyenne into reservations at any cost.was completed, slashing journey 
times: by 1876, it was possible to travel from New York to California in three and a half days.
Settlers and victims
Immigration was the fuel that powered these transformations, the new lands demanding a vast influx of new settlers. In 1803, the US population stood at 4 million. By 1861, it was 31 million; and by the turn of the century, 76 million. There were inevitable costs to  such rapid growth, and American Indians paid the highest price. Driven off their tribal lands with relentless brutality, their numbers dropped from perhaps as many as 4.5 million to 500,000. Herded into reservations, their traditional way of life destroyed, they were helpless in the face of this seemingly irresistible expansion.

Progress  (1872) depicts the concept  
of manifest destiny. In it, the figure of Columbia, representing the USA, lays telegraph wires and leads settlers west.

 THE OPENING OF ELLIS ISLAND (1892) 
By the mid-19th century, the 
world was experiencing an unprecedented boom in 
population, particularly in Europe. This increase would continue into the 20th century and beyond. It  was partly due to improvements  in health, backed by more ready access to food as a consequence  of improved agricultural methods. It was also a result of industrialization and urban growth, as well as the affluence and improved living standards that both produced. Political stability played a role, too. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Europe enjoyed almost 100 years of largely unbroken peace.IN CONTEXT

Nature also had a hand in the 
increase in migration. The Irish potato famine of the 1840s, resulting from a failed crop, may have been the last major European famine, but it brought suffering on a startling scale: up to 1 million people died. It provoked among survivors a vast wave of emigration of over 1 million, almost all to the US. The population of Ireland in 1841 was 6.5 million; by 1871, it had dipped to 4 million. 
Urban underclass
Industrialization produced a similar paradox. Whatever the civic pride and bombast of the immense new urban centers of the Industrial Revolution, especially in Britain, a new urban underclass was being created, desperately impoverished and living in extreme squalor.
For the citizens of continental 
Europe, the lure of new lands in which to be free and prosper would prove irresistible. Substantial numbers of Germans, Czechs, and Hungarians left central Europe after the suppression of the nationalist revolts of 1848. From 1870, huge numbers of Russian and Polish Jews—1.5 million in 1901–10  alone—similarly emigrated,  fleeing anti-Semitic pogroms. 
The numbers involved in this 
huge transfer of populations were remarkable. From the mid-19th century to 1924, 18 million people emigrated from Britain, 9.5 million from Italy, mostly from its deprived south, 8 million from Russia, 5 million from Austria-Hungary, and 4.5 million from Germany. Between 1820 and 1920, the US attracted 33.6 million immigrants, where  
they often found themselves in  
poor living conditions in rapidly expanding cities such as Chicago and New York, aiding the growth  
of American industry with their cheap labor. Over the same period, 3.6 million Europeans settled in South America, and 2 million in Australia and New Zealand. 
Unwelcome guests
This process of relocation was  not exclusively European. Indians settled in South Africa, Chinese migrants spread across the East Indies, and Japanese migrants settled in California; many found themselves unwelcome.
There were also victims of 
enforced emigration. Unknown numbers of black African slaves were still being shipped around  the world. 
By 1910, more than one in seven 
of the US population had been born outside of the United States.

40 percent of the immigrant population of the United States has at least one relative who  
was fed through this immense bureaucratic machine. Built on nothing more than a nondescript sandy island, close to the New Jersey shore in New York Harbor, Ellis Island had at its heart a vast, echoing hall. Here, shuffling forward, the newly arrived immigrants, speaking  
a dazzling array of languages, would be processed. They were examined medically before being subjected to a series of simple questions to establish their eligibility. The great majority would then become accepted as citizens of the United States, with scarcely 2 percent turned away. Ellis Island finally closed its doors  
on November 12, 1954.

 THE MEIJI RESTORATION (1868)
The overthrow in 1868 of  
the Tokugawa shogunate, 
rulers of Japan for 250 
years, was led by feudal barons from the southern provinces of Choshu and Satsuma and was the direct consequence of its weakness in the face of aggressive demands by the United States, Britain, Russia, and the Netherlands to establish trading links. In place of the shoguns, the pliant 14-year-old Meiji emperor would “exercise supreme authority.” The goal of the barons was not to take over and maintain Japan as it had existed under the shogunate—  
rigidly hierarchical and deliberately isolated from the wider world. IN CONTEXT

Rather, it was that they felt

Japan transformed
There followed a transformation of  a kind no society had seen before or has seen since. Modeling itself on the West, in 30 years Japan became one of the most dynamic industrial powers in the world and the leading military power in East Asia.
Almost no aspect of Japanese 
society was left untouched by this whirlwind of change. In 1871, Japan abolished feudalism and established the yen as its currency. By 1872, the first railway was under construction; within 15 years, there was 1,000 miles (1,600km) of track. In 1873, Japan introduced conscription,  along with Western weapons and uniforms. The same year saw an overhaul of the education system, and in 1877 Japan’s first university was established in Tokyo. Japan also introduced a new legal code in 1882, and a new constitution seven years later. As industry boomed,  so exports grew. Cities similarly expanded, as did the population, swelling from 39.5 million in 1888 to 55 million by 1918.The spur to modernization had largely been the fear that Japan, like China, would become another Western colonial pawn. In fact, the opposite occurred. 
Military expansion
By the 1890s, Japan was a colonial power. In 1894, Korea had asked both Japan and China to help curb an insurrection there. When both countries later sought to take over Korea, the Japanese swept the Chinese aside, and then demanded and received possession of Taiwan, as well as rights in Manchuria. Here they came into conflict with Russia. The Japanese victory in 1905 over a disorganized Russian fleet at the Battle of Tsushima Strait was the first time an industrial European power had been defeated by an Asian power. Japan had the world’s attention.

Emperor Meiji Important not as a statesman  
or as the ruler of Japan in the 
sense of exercising actual power, Emperor Meiji (1852–1912)—  
whose personal name, never  
used, was Mutsuhito—was instead the symbol of the reborn Japan. Until the restoration  
of Meiji in January 1868, the emperors of Japan were little  
more than a symbol. Under the shogunate, they were obliged  
to remain invisibly at the royal palace in Kyoto more or less permanently. Strictly speaking, the “restoration” never happened: Meiji had already become emperor in February 1867, following the sudden death of his father, Emperor Komei. 
For those ambitious daimyo , 
or feudal barons, who were determined to drive Japan into the modern world, elevating  
the emperor to a higher profile bestowed legitimacy on what was otherwise an act of usurpation. It is telling that one of their first acts was to force the emperor to move to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo in 1868, the former residence of the shogun. Meiji himself remained an impenetrable cypher to the end.

 THE SECOND OPIUM WAR (1856–1860)
On October 6, 1860, after 
years of sporadic conflict known as the Second 
Opium War, an Anglo-French force seized the imperial capital of Peking (today Beijing), in China, to force  
the Chinese to submit to trading concessions. The point was underlined when the Europeans burned down the emperor’s sumptuous Summer Palace. The Chinese agreed to talks, and the resulting Peking Convention not only increased the number of Treaty Ports open to Western trade, but British and French zones of influence were extended in south China and along the fertile Yangtze River.

Less than 70 years before, Britain 
had sent an embassy to China to open trade talks, only to be rebuffed. Late 18th-century Qing China was the richest, most populous, and most powerful country in the world, and it could afford its complacency.  
By the mid-19th century, however, the nation was effectively bankrupt, racked by famines and revolts,  
and increasingly exploited and humiliated by the West.
Uprisings and revolts
China’s problems were internal  as much as external. A swelling population—100 million in 1650, 300 million in 1800, 450 million  in 1850—provoked recurring famines. Between 1787 and 1813, there were three major uprisings. Its border provinces, conquered  at huge expense in the 17th and 18th centuries, were in a near-permanent state of unrest. 
In 1850, the Taiping Rebellion 
erupted across central China, resulting in the death of as many  as 20 million people. When it was finally put down, in 1864, it was only after Western intervention. The Qing dynasty, its administration increasingly ineffective, had essentially lost control of China.
The West intrudes
It was this growing turmoil that  the West exploited, weakening China further in the process. The first, modest trading concessions China had agreed to stipulated that all Chinese goods be paid for in silver. However, from the early  19th century, European traders, mostly by bribing officials, were increasingly able to use opium, cheaply grown in India, to pay for goods. By the 1820s, 5,000 chests of opium a year were entering China. 
The Chinese attempt to end  
the opium trade and its debilitating effects led to a crushing defeat in the First Opium War of 1839–42, with the European powers, Britain above all, extracting substantial trading concessions. It was Western insistence in 1856 that these concessions be extended  that led to the Second Opium War, concluded in 1860 by the Peking Convention. By 1900, a string  of Western trading ports were scattered along the Chinese coast. Britain, France, Japan, and Russia now all controlled what had been Chinese tributary states on its borders. China, wracked by turmoil, was effectively disintegrating.

The Boxer Rebellion
In the turmoil of late 19th-
century China, it was inevitable that efforts would be mounted to end the growing dominance of the West. The imperial government in Beijing made a last-ditch attempt at reform on Western lines, but the chaos came to a head in 1899 with the Boxer Rebellion, mounted by the Militia United in Righteousness, a semi-secret society composed mostly of young men. Its goal,  
to be achieved in part thanks to their deluded belief that they were invulnerable to Western weapons, was the overthrow  
of all Western interests.  
The rebellion was variously supported and opposed by  
the imperial court, uncertain whether it represented a means of salvation or would merely provoke Western reprisals.  
The latter proved to be the  
case. An eight-nation military alliance, including Japan,  
was sent into China against  
the Boxers, and by September 1901 the rebellion had been crushed, amid scenes of indiscriminate violence.

 THAN I AM
 THE OPENING OF THE EIFFEL TOWER (1889)
The opening of the Eiffel 
Tower on March 31, 1889 was a startling assertion  
of Parisian bombast in the years between the humiliations of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–71 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914. This was the Belle Epoque,  a time when Paris could—and  did—confidently proclaim itself  the City of Light, supremely cosmopolitan, the art capital of the world, and the epicenter of civilized living. Paris was the city reborn, and over it now soared Gustave Eiffel’s tower, at 984ft (300m) not just the tallest structure in the world, but a triumphant monument to technological progress.
The ideal city
Modern Paris was the creation of Napoleon III. Beginning in 1853, the French emperor had whole districts knocked down, replacing medieval buildings and tangles of tiny streets with imposingly vast boulevards. It was urban planning on a scale never seen before. Train stations were built, water supplies improved, sewers constructed, parks laid out, and stunning vistas created. The goal was a model  city, one that would reflect not  just the glory of France but also  its mastery of the modern age.
It was a process mirrored in 
cities across the industrial West.  In 1850, there were three European cities with populations larger than 500,000: Paris, London, and Constantinople. Fifty years later, there were nine with populations larger than 1 million, and by  1900, London was the largest  city in the world, with 6.5 million inhabitants. The same dizzying growth occurred in the US,  
The Eiffel Tower was erected in  
time for the Universal Exposition of 1889. At the time, it was the world’s tallest structure. It has since come to represent Paris to the entire world. IN CONTEXT

too—between 1850 and 1900, the 
population of Chicago, for example, tripled, from 560,000 to 1.7 million.
Difficulties and inventions 
The initial consequence of this population explosion was quite staggering urban squalor. Diseases such as cholera and typhoid were commonplace. It became clear that the infrastructure demanded by any modern city had to include not just adequate public transport and well-lit streets, for example, but major improvements in public health—above all, sanitation.
The shift in the quality of life  
in these great metropolises was extraordinary. It was paralleled  by the rapid development of  mass consumerism, the direct consequence of improved living standards, shorter working hours, and compulsory education, with basic literacy and numeracy now increasingly commonplace. It was an age of music halls and popular theater, and subsequently of the cinema; of the phonograph; of mass-circulation newspapers; and of a growing interest in sports. 
Just as central to this age of 
growing affluence and increased leisure—at least for some—were the first department stores. These were a conspicuous part of a retail revolution that was coupled, from the 1870s, with an advertising explosion, with color posters mass-  
produced for the first time. And from the 1890s in the United States, cityscapes were further changed by a new type of building: skyscrapers. Just as the Eiffel Tower before them, they rapidly became symbols of the transformation in urban life. 
■Underground railways
Between 1800 and 1900, the 
population density in New York rose from 39,183 per square mile to 90,366, and  
the congestion was worsening as public transportation took up valuable land. A solution favored in the United States was an elevated railway— a train line raised above  
the streets on steel girders. The first was opened in New York in 1868. 
In the UK, the same space 
constraints led to the birth  
of the underground railway.  
The first, using conventional steam engines, was London’s Metropolitan Railway, which opened in 1863 and linked Paddington and King’s Cross stations with the City of London. Soon extended and combined with the District Line, by 1871 it encircled almost the whole of central London. The city’s first electric underground service—faster, quieter, and much less dirty—  
was opened in 1890. Paris followed suit with the opening of the Métro, named after the London line, in 1900, and the first US underground service opened in Boston in 1897.Industrialization  and

 THE BERLIN CONFERENCE (1884)
The Berlin Conference  
did not precipitate the sudden European takeover 
of Africa after 1880 but, rather, confirmed Europe’s self-asserted right to impose itself on a continent deemed backward, ignorant,  and savage. Called by Otto von Bismarck, Germany’s chancellor, the conference was held over the winter of 1884–85 and attended by representatives from 14 countries. It was intended in part to legitimize a more or less enforced subjection of Africa and, by setting agreed rules of colonization, to avoid conflict between Europe’s colonial powers, France and Britain most obviously.

It was also seen as a way to end the

At the same time, it paved the way for Germany and Belgium, two nations with no history of colonial rule, to become major imperial powers. For Germany, this was little more than a logical next step in its challenge to Britain and France. If they could boast vast colonial possessions, Germany felt it should, too. 
The European takeover
Before colonization, Africa possessed a variety of states and territories, some quite precisely defined, some amorphously tribal—there was  an extreme contrast between  the sophistication of Egypt, for example, and the Congo in tropical Africa. At the same time, much of the north was Muslim. The first European holdings in Africa were coastal trading forts, sustained  by gold and the slave trade. The interior remained impenetrable, but as it was revealed from the early 1800s, European control of Africa gained momentum.The subsequent heightening  of tensions resulted in the near-complete reduction of Africa to European rule. African colonies were essentially artificial creations, lines drawn on maps to suit the colonizing powers. They took  no notice of local histories and cultures, and any local resistance to colonization was invariably crushed by military means. 
Belgian and German rule
In 1885, Leopold II, the King of  the Belgians, proclaimed the establishment of the Congo Free State, an area 76 times larger  than Belgium. Presented as  a model colony, dedicated to humanitarian ends and free trade,  
in reality it was anything but. 
Treated by Leopold II as his 
personal possession, the Congo witnessed brutalities on a near-genocidal scale. The exact numbers can never be known, but it is believed that between 2 million  and 10 million Congolese died. Conditions in German southwest Africa, suddenly taken over after 1884 and today part of Namibia, were equally brutal . The true price 
of the riches produced by Africa  for its European masters—ivory, rubber, gold, and diamonds—was extraordinary suffering.

Cecil Rhodes There was no more ardent 
exponent of British imperial  
rule in Africa than Cecil Rhodes (1853–1902), financier, statesman, and relentless imperialist. He envisaged a continuous body of British colonies that would run north and south across Africa, linking the two strategically  
vital extremities of Africa: Cape Town and Cairo. Having made  
his fortune mining and selling diamonds in South Africa, he dedicated the rest of his life to this audacious vision. He was able to carve out new British territories in Northern Rhodesia (now part of Zambia) and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), which were both named after him. As the prime minister of Britain’s Cape Colony from 1890, his relentless scheming to topple the Boer republics led to his eventual political demise in 1895. He remains perhaps the most striking example of the unashamed imperialist, not  
just permanently ready to extend British colonial control, but convinced that it was his duty to do so in the interests  
of what seemed to him a self-evident European fitness to rule.

 THE YOUNG TURK REVOLUTION (1908)
T  he Young Turk Revolution 
of July 1908 was instigated by nationalistic army 
officers dismayed by the territorial losses of the Ottoman Empire. It forced the sultan—the Ottoman ruler, the ineffective but repressive Abdul Hamid II—to reintroduce the constitutional monarchy that he had suspended in 1878 in favor  of personal rule after only two years. In 1909, he was forced to abdicate in favor of his brother, Mehmed V, who was merely  
a figurehead.

Territorial decline
In 1800, despite repeated defeats  at the hands of the Russians, Ottoman Turkey still ruled over  a vast multinational empire that stretched across the Balkans, the Middle East, and North Africa. From 1805, it lost control of  Egypt, which became effectively independent under one of the sultan’s generals, Muhammad Ali.
In 1830, the year that France 
began its conquest of Algeria (completed in 1857), Greece won  
its independence; and by 1878, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria,  
and Romania were similarly independent in all but name.  
In 1881, Tunisia, too, was taken over by France.
Following the Young Turk 
Revolution, the relentless decline  of Ottoman Turkey continued. In 1911, Libya was lost to Italy, while the Balkan Wars of 1912–13 saw the surrender of almost all of Turkey’s remaining European territories.
A fateful alliance
Following the Balkan crisis, the Ottomans’ military government launched a drive to modernize  
the country along Western lines.  In October 1914, Turkey entered World War I as an ally of the Central Powers—Germany and Austria-Hungary—convinced that German military aid would allow  
it to reassert its potency. This  
was a calamitous mistake, and defeat in 1918 saw Turkey reduced to its Anatolian heartlands, its remaining Middle East territories lost, largely carved up between Britain and France.
The traumas of Turkey’s defeat 
in World War I were underlined in 1920 by the Treaty of Sèvres, largely a Franco-British imposition. This confirmed the loss of Ottoman territory and also awarded much  of western Turkey to Greece, provoking an immediate nationalist backlash led by Mustafa Kemal,  as well as the overthrow of the  last sultan, Mehmed VI. 
The Turkey that emerged under 
Kemal, subsequently styled Atatürk (“Father of the Turks”), was exactly the centralized Western-style and, importantly, secular state that nationalist reformers such as the Young Turks had argued for.

 THE DEATH OF EMILY DAVISON (1913)
On June 4, 1913, Emily 
Davison stepped onto  the course at the Derby, 
England’s premier horse race, and was knocked to the ground by a horse owned by King George V. She died four days later. It is unclear if this was a protest that went wrong or an active attempt at martyrdom. However, the intended disruption was typical of the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU), which Davison had joined in 1906.

the United States had left them asking why women should not be entitled to vote. In 1903, Emmeline Pankhurst founded the WSPU with the aim of using militant tactics  
to further this cause. Its slogan declared “Deeds not words,” and  
the tactics of the suffragettes,  as the vote-seeking women were  
by now mockingly known, became increasingly violent. Chaining themselves to public buildings and the disruption of meetings escalated into the smashing of shop windows, acts of arson, and bombings.

WSPU were repeatedly arrested and imprisoned: Pankhurst received seven prison sentences; Davison, nine. In 1909, the WSPU began to stage hunger strikes in prison; in response they were force-fed—a painful and degrading process. 
The US: the suffragists
The experience of what in the US were known as the suffragists  had clear parallels. The Women’s Christian Temperance Union campaigned peacefully for women’s rights, arguing that women could not influence political decisions— in this case, Prohibition—without having the right to vote.
However, the National Women’s 
Party (NWP), established in 1916, imitated the militant tactics of Britain’s WSPU. This was no surprise, given that its founder, Alice Paul, had been a member of the WSPU from 1907 to 1910 and had been sent to prison three times. The NWP’s so-called Silent Sentinels, protesting outside the White House from January 1917, were also arrested and force-fed. 
Success at last
At the outbreak of World War I,  the WSPU stopped campaigning, mobilizing itself instead in support of the war effort. The contribution made by women during the war plainly demonstrated just how much wider their role could be than that traditionally expected of them as wives and mothers. In 1918, all British women aged 30 or over  were granted the right to vote.  In 1928, suffrage in Britain was extended to women aged 21 or over.
Meanwhile, in the United States, 
the NWP continued its protest into 1919, when Congress approved the Nineteenth Amendment, which was ratified the following year, granting women the same voting rights as men.

Emmeline Pankhurst The best known of all the 
suffragettes, Emmeline Pankhurst (1858–1928) epitomized a new breed of politically active women in the early 20th century. She was born into—and later remained  
in by marriage—an eminently respectable, somewhat left-leaning middle-class world in  
the north of England, which only served to cement her desire to further the cause of women’s rights. This decision would prove explosive. She was single-minded, exceptionally active, and wholly unflinching in her refusal to compromise. Her leadership  of the WSPU exhibited a determination to take the fight for women’s suffrage into the heart of what she saw as the enemy camp. Her increasing readiness to use more violent methods to secure suffragette goals alienated many who may otherwise have been her natural supporters—women as much as men. Nonetheless, her absolute refusal to back down, coupled with the fervor she inspired  
in her followers, introduced a new mood of feminist militancy into a complacent masculine political world.

THE PARTITIONS OF 
POLAND
(1772–95)
From 1569 to the 18th century, 
Poland and Lithuania were united in a large federated commonwealth that occupied an extensive area  of northern Europe. In 1772,  
the powerful neighbors of the commonwealth—Austria, Prussia,  and Russia—encroached on its territory in a series of annexations, diminishing it until they absorbed it fully in 1795. Russia took over the eastern half of the country; Prussia, the north; and Austria, the southern and central parts. The elimination of the Polish state bolstered these three great European powers, leaving Polish patriots to struggle for independence, which they achieved in 1918.
THE SIKH EMPIRE  
IS FOUNDED
(1799)
Maharaja Ranjit Singh brought together a group of Sikh states  in and surrounding the Punjab region of northern India to create  a powerful Sikh Empire in 1799.  For its creation and defense, it drew on the Khalsa, the powerful united army that had been created in the 1730s by Sikh leader Nawab Kapur Singh. The empire lasted for 50 years before falling to the British. Although not long-lasting, it helped to strengthen Sikh unity and confirmed the close identification of the Sikhs with the Punjab region.firepower. The British divided up their kingdom, eventually adding Zululand to their empire.
THE TRAIL OF TEARS 
(1830)
In 1830, the US Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which granted Native Americans lands west of the Mississippi in return for them surrendering their lands within existing state boundaries in the east. Although the removal was in theory voluntary, in fact it resulted in the eviction of tens of thousands of people from their homelands  on a forced westward march that became known as the Trail of Tears. The people forced to move were mainly Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole. Among the Cherokee alone, some 4,000 died during the march. 
THE IRISH FAMINE 
(1845–49)
In the 1840s, the rapidly growing rural population of Ireland suffered a series of disastrously poor crops of their staple food, the potato. These bad harvests, due to potato blight that spread rapidly in the damp weather, led to about  1 million people dying of starvation, while another million emigrated either to Britain or North America. After the famine ended, emigration, especially to the US, continued as landlords evicted tenants as part of estate “rationalization.” The famine was a terrible and pivotal event in FURTHER EVENTS
THE WAR OF 1812
(1812–15)
In 1812, the United States declared war on Britain over a number of issues, including trade restrictions, British commandeering of US merchant seamen, and the support lent by Britain to American Indian peoples who opposed US expansion into their lands to the west. The conflict took place on several  fronts across North America and involved a failed US invasion of Canada, the burning of the city  of Washington by the British in 1814, and a major US victory at  New Orleans in 1815. After more than two years of fighting, the status quo was largely restored. However, the war gave the US a stronger sense of nationhood and confirmed that Canada remained part of the British Empire. 
THE RISE AND FALL  
OF THE ZULU KINGDOM
(c.1816–87)
Shaka, ruler of a small Zulu chiefdom, was a dynamic leader who formed a Zulu state after  1816 by conquering and uniting  a large number of groups of the Nguni people of southeast Africa. The Zulu kingdom had to contend with two belligerent groups of incomers: the Boers (descendants of Dutch settlers at the Cape) and the British. The British invaded Zulu territory in 1879 and, after suffering an initial defeat at Isandiwana, overwhelmed them with their

THE TAIPING REBELLION
(1850–64)
By the mid-19th century, Qing  
rule in China had become corrupt, and there were many who wanted change. Among various anti-government groups was one led by a religious leader, Hong Xiuquan. Hong’s followers attacked Nanjing and took the city in 1853. The rebellion grew and spread across virtually all of China until it became a war with hundreds of thousands of fighters involved. With European military aid, the Qings eventually managed to crush the rebels, and millions of soldiers and civilians were killed. Despite its failure, the Taiping Rebellion fatally weakened the Qing regime, which only survived for another half century, increasingly prey to foreign powers.
THE CRIMEAN WAR
(1853–56)
When war broke out between Russia and Turkey in 1853, France and Britain intervened in support  of Turkey, sending a joint force to invade the Crimea and besiege the Russian port of Sebastapol. There were huge numbers of casualties, particularly on the Russian side, before Russia agreed to peace terms. Blunders such as the British cavalry’s infamous, suicidal Charge of the Light Brigade made the war notorious for the needless waste of human life. The Crimean War also came to be associated with the efforts of health reformers such as Florence Nightingale, who worked to improve the nursing service offered to the wounded and to improve training for nurses in both military and civilian hospitals.
FRANCE RETURNS TO A 
REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT
(1870)
In 1870, Emperor Napoleon III of 
France surrendered at the Battle  of Sedan, during the Franco-Prussian War, and he was taken prisoner. The French parliament declared a republic, expecting it  to form an interim government  until a new monarch was chosen. However, it proved impossible  to decide on a constitutional framework for a new monarchy,  or on who should take the throne. After elections in 1871, the Third Republic became permanent, with a president as head of state and a Chamber of Deputies, elected through universal male suffrage,  to make the laws. The Third Republic lasted until 1940 and  set the pattern for French government after World War II.
A MAHDIST ISLAMIC STATE 
IS CREATED IN SUDAN
(1885)
In 1881, the Sudanese leader 
Muhammad Ahmad declared himself the Mahdi (a messianic figure in some Muslim traditions) and launched a revolt against the government of Egypt, which ruled Sudan although Britain effectively controlled both countries. Ahmad laid siege to Khartoum, which fell in early 1885, in spite of a defense by Charles George Gordon, the British Governor-General. The Mahdists were finally defeated by Lord Kitchener in 1898, after which Sudan was ruled jointly by Britain and Egypt.
THE [SECOND] BOER WAR
(1899–1902)
The war of 1899–1902 was the second conflict between the Boers (South Africans of Dutch descent) and the British. After initial Boer victories, the British defeated their enemies by applying a “scorched earth” policy in the areas of the country in which the Boers had fought successfully as guerrillas, and capturing women and children. Some 20,000 died in concentration camps, and the Boers lost their independence. The war reduced many surviving Boers to poverty, but it also spurred on their nationalism and indirectly led  
to Afrikaaner dominance of  
South Africa’s government in  
the 20th century.
THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION
(1910)
Beginning in 1910 and initially led by Francisco Madero, the Mexican Revolution removed the dictator Porfirio Diaz, who had ruled for some 35 years. However, the  new republic could not prevent armed factional struggles and civil war, which continued until the drawing up of a new constitution  in 1917 and the election of a new government in 1920. The following two decades saw key reforms such as the redistribution of lands among peasants and Indian communities and, in 1938,  the nationalization of oil.

Historical perspectives on 
events close to the present day are inevitably shifting 
and uncertain. A historian writing in the mid-20th century might have characterized the modern era as a period of catastrophe, in which all the economic and political gains  of liberal civilization had been squandered. However, by the early 21st century it was tempting to see continuity with the pre-1914 world, as a globalized capitalist economy and great technological innovation were combined with rapidly rising population and productivity. 
The two world wars 
The convulsions of the period from 1914 to 1950 were on an epic scale. Two world wars between them caused the deaths of between  70 and 100 million people, making them by far the most destructive conflicts in history. Both European civilization and science—the twin pillars of the traditional 19th-century idea of “progress”—were tarnished by association with this slaughter. Germany, often considered one of Europe’s most “civilized” countries, descended into dictatorship and genocidal massacre. Science was used to create weapons of mass destruction, from poison gas to the atom bomb. Even in the interlude  of relative peace between the world wars, global capitalism failed to function effectively, the economic misery of the Great Depression driving a retreat from democratic government and free markets. 
To revolutionaries inspired by  
a Marxist vision, these upheavals seemed the death throes of the capitalist order. But the building of alternative “communist” societies, based on the model of a single-party state and a state-controlled economy, proved to be a costly experiment. In Russia, followed by China, communism succeeded in transforming relatively undeveloped countries into major industrial and military powers, but millions died as victims of the state, and citizens were denied fundamental freedoms. 
A battle of ideology 
World War II was followed by the Cold War confrontation between the “free world,” led by the United States, and the communist bloc. Instead of disarmament, there was a potentially disastrous nuclear arms race. Meanwhile, the main European powers, economically weakened and demoralized, found themselves in no position to sustain INTRODUCTION

In the end, the issue was settled 
by economics. Capitalism showed its ability to generate economic growth on a vast scale, creating a booming consumer society in more advanced countries. In contrast,  by the 1980s communist countries confronted economic stagnation and rising popular discontent. With great rapidity, communist regimes collapsed in the Soviet bloc, while communist China later became a powerhouse of capitalism.
In the wake of communism, the 
political scientist Francis Fukuyama coined the expression the “end of history” and argued that Western liberal democracy was “the only game in town.” Certainly, by the end of the 20th century liberalism was surfing a wave: in 1950, only a few nations in Europe were democracies; 50 years later, all of them were. 
Progress and pessimism
From the 1960s, hotly contested campaigns for civil rights had progressed liberal ideals in areas such as racial equality and gender politics. Growing prosperity was also impressive. In Latin America and much of Asia, living standards had risen dramatically by the early 21st century. Despite the world’s population increasing on a huge scale—from under 2 billion in 1914 to over 7 billion one century later— food supplies had not run out, as had once been predicted by many. Restricting environmental damage was recognized as a major challenge for the future, a problem generated by humanity’s growth and success.  
Indeed, human progress in the 
20th century was remarkable, from rising literacy and life expectancy to the development of air and space travel and computers. Yet there was no outbreak of general optimism. Environmental issues aside, it was all too evident that the future held potential dangers: the unsettled politics of the Middle East, sucking major powers into wars; brutal acts of terrorism; economic inequality generating mass migration; financial instability and market breakdown; epidemics spread by global travel—all provided plenty of material for pessimists. History offered no solid ground for predictions, suggesting only that the unexpected was to  be expected.

 THE BATTLE OF PASSCHENDAELE (1914)
US_270-275_Passchendale.indd   271 15/02/2016   16:44272
Passchendaele, officially 
known as the Third Battle of Ypres, was a large- 
scale attack against the German front line around Ypres, Belgium, during World War I. The Allies’  aim was to advance into Belgium and free the German-held ports  on the Belgian coast, which  
the Germans had been using to attack British shipping. The  
biggest challenge was to break through the defensive positions taken by the Germans on the  
West Flanders Ridge. Key to the breakthrough was seizing the village of Passchendaele.
Preparations for the battle 
began on June 7, 1917 with a heavy two-week bombardment of German positions. The infantry offensive began on July 31, 1917. Within days, the Allied forces were stuck in mud as torrential rain turned the area into a quagmire. By the time the Allies—made up of British, French, Canadian, and Australian troops—captured Passchendaele on November 6, the village was in ruins. The conflict cost 300,000 Allied lives, with a gain of 5 miles (8km), while the Germans lost 260,000 of their troops. It was hailed as a victory by the British government but became a byword for the utter futility of war. 
Secret diplomacy
Two main disputes led to World War I: one between Germany and France, and the other between Russia and Austria-Hungary. The long history of mutual antipathy between Germany and France came to a head in 1870 with France’s humiliating defeat by Germany in the Franco-Prussian 
Life in the trenches At the outbreak of World War I, 
both sides anticipated fast-moving battles that would cover hundreds of miles. None expected a static fight with their forces deep in defensive trenches. 
Early trenches were small 
furrows, but they grew more elaborate, fortified with wooden frames and sandbags. German trenches were more sophisticated and had electricity and toilets. Soldiers spent daylight hours avoiding enemy fire and endured periods of boredom and daily chores, broken up with spells in reserve and short rest periods. The trenches sometimes filled up with rats and lice, as well  
as water, which turned to ice. Life in such conditions was exhausting, and soldiers had  
a repetitive diet of canned food  
and few comforts. 
Snipers shot at any heads 
that appeared over the parapet, and raiding parties throwing grenades were a constant danger. The trenches were bombarded with shells, bullets, and poisonous gas. It was a relentless war of attrition—smelly, dirty, and riddled  with disease.THE BATTLE OF PASSCHENDAELE

a small professional troop led by Sir 
Douglas Haig, had arrived in France by August 22. It was deployed near the Franco-Belgian border, in line with pre-war military plans agreed with the French government. 
Germany had to fight a war on 
two fronts. On the Western Front,  in the first weeks of the conflict,  the Germans invaded Belgium  and France, but their advance  was halted by the French and British at the Battle of the Marne.  By the end of autumn, the two  sides had reached a stalemate. Meanwhile, on the Eastern Front, the fighting remained fluid. Germany dominated, scoring a great victory against the Russians at Tannenberg, but its Austrian allies suffered several defeats.  
On the Western Front, however,  
a 400-mile (645km) trench line stretched from the Belgian coast  
in the north, down through eastern France to the Swiss border. The two sides faced each other across the open space between their front lines. This area—no-man’s-land—had barbed wire fronting the trenches to slow the opposition. Continuous fighting from the trenches, punctuated by appallingly bloody battles, failed to break the deadlock. More than 600,000 Allied troops were killed or wounded in the Battle of the Somme alone.

New mechanized weapons added to the high casualty rates. Tanks were used for the first time, and machine guns such as the German MG 08 Maxim could fire up to 600 bullets

of logistical operations, but as  
the war progressed, railways and motor trucks were used to transport goods to the front. 
Civilians were brought into  
the front line by the bombing of London and Paris by airships and bomber aircraft. By 1917, German submarines were sinking one in four merchant ships headed for Britain to try to starve the British into submission. Britain’s naval blockade of Germany also led to

There were food shortages, and workers in the cities faced low wages and appalling conditions. The February Revolution had ousted the Tsar, but the Provisional Government that replaced him faced imminent collapse. 
Vladimir Lenin, a member of the 
revolutionary Bolshevik Party, took full advantage. He was committed to a workers’ (proletarian) revolution and set out a series of proposals to overthrow the government in what became known as his April Theses. His simple slogan “Peace, land, and bread!” became a revolutionary IN CONTEXT

Soldiers refused to obey orders to fire on the crowd, but police shot and killed 50 people. 
Rise of revolutionary parties
With violence erupting on city streets, the Tsar abdicated in March, having relinquished power to the Provisional Government in February, with Prince Georgi Y. Lvov as its head. The government still represented only the middle classes and continued to back Russia’s involvement in World War I. Groups such as the Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers, a council made up of workers and peasants agitating for change, grew stronger and gained power within the Provisional Government. Lenin, in exile for revolutionary activities, was anxious to return to Petrograd, convinced that the collapse of  
world capitalism was imminent.  
He received the help of the German government, which hoped that  
he could further destabilize the political situation in Russia for their war effort, and arrived secretly in a sealed train. Full of revolutionary zeal, he was determined to shape a new Russian government according to his ideas, and he accused his associates of not doing enough to overthrow the current regime. 
Prime Minister Lvov resigned 
after the disastrous July Offensive on the Western Front. His successor, Alexander Kerensky, formed a  
new socialist government with  the Petrograd Soviet, but he, too, insisted on keeping Russia in the war. After mass demonstrations  in Petrograd encouraged by the Bolsheviks, Kerensky banned them and arrested many of their leaders. Lenin fled to Finland. 
Revolution is nigh 
In August, Kerensky faced a new threat. General Lavr Kornilov, Russia’s army commander-in-chief, ordered troops into Petrograd. Kerensky believed that Kornilov was plotting to seize power. In desperation, he released the Bolsheviks, who armed those  who wanted to prevent a counter-revolution. This was a massive boost for their cause. They were able to represent themselves to the people as defenders of Petrograd. By September the Bolsheviks had taken control of the Petrograd Soviet. Lenin seized the moment, THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION

calls for revolution. He handed responsibility for military tactics  to Leon Trotsky, a fellow Marxist. Peasants and farmers were revolting in rural areas, workers in the cities. Lenin decided the time was ripe for a Bolshevik seizure of power. The Bolsheviks took government buildings and the Winter Palace, where Kerensky’s cabinet had sought refuge. 
On the night of October 25 
(November 7, GC), Lenin issued a brief address to the Russian people: “The Provisional Government has been overthrown. Long live the workers, soldiers, and peasant revolution!” After this initial triumph, Lenin was compelled to hold democratic elections, but the Bolsheviks received only a quarter of the vote. Lenin dissolved the elected government and sent armed guards to prevent it meeting again. In February 1918, he signed a peace treaty with Germany, but the terms were extremely harsh.  Russia ceded the Baltic States to Germany, while Ukraine, Finland, and Estonia were transformed  into independent states. Russia was also forced to pay six billion German marks in reparations.  This move freed the Bolsheviks from the German threat, but the terms of the treaty were deeply unpopular. Many regarded it as  a betrayal of their country.

The Bolsheviks were a minority

The founding of the United Nations 340After four years of global 
conflict, 16 million people had died and centuries- 
old empires and dynasties had collapsed. In January 1919, the victors of World War I met to discuss the terms of peace. US Presiden t Woodrow Wilson had 
devised a plan that he believed would bring a new order to Europe based on democracy. Wilson pushed for a League of Nations  to act as arbiter and peacemaker  in national disputes. 
Britain and France wanted  
to ensure that Germany would never again be able to threaten European peace. The German Army was to be reduced and the Rhineland demilitarized. Germany was also asked to give up lands to France on its west and to Poland  on its east and north. In addition, the Austro-Hungarian empires were to be split into new nations such as Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia; and the Ottoman Empire was also to be carved up,  to the advantage of the British  and French. 
War-guilt clause
Crucially, in a “war-guilt clause,” the Germans had to admit to starting the war and also pay £6.6 billion in reparations. They signed the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919 but stalled in paying compensation, so in 1923 France occupied Germany’s industrial Ruhr Valley. However, in the interwar years, neither of those nations did anything to deter aggression by Nazi Germany. When Adolf Hitler took France in 1940, he ordered the master copy of the treaty to be burned.

FUTURE OF THE UNITED

 THE WALL STREET CRASH (1929)
Over six desperate days  
in October 1929, shares  on the New York Stock 
Exchange crashed. The downturn began on October 23rd, when stocks from car manufacturer General Motors were sold at a loss and the market started to collapse. Panic set in, and the next day the market nose-dived. 
On Tuesday October 29, which 
became known as Black Tuesday, stock prices plunged even lower.  In total, $25 billion, approximately $319 billion in today’s market, was lost. It was the biggest financial catastrophe ever, and it plunged the world into the Great Depression. 
Roaring Twenties
The US had recovered quickly after World War I, and factories that had made supplies for the war effort switched to producing consumer goods such as cars and radios. The growth of new technologies and mass production saw economic output increase by 50 percent; the age of prosperity and consumerism that resulted became known as  the Roaring Twenties. 
Newspapers and magazines 
were filled with stories of people becoming rich overnight by dabbling in the stock market, and thousands of ordinary Americans bought shares, increasing the demand for them and inflating their value. Between 1920 and 1929, the number of shareowners rose from 4 million to 20 million. 
By late 1929, there were signs  
of trouble within the American economy: unemployment was  on the rise, steel production  was declining, construction was slowing, and car sales had dipped. Still confident they could make  a fortune, some people continued  to invest on the stock market.

However, when the stock prices 
began to drop in October 1929, panic set in. The ensuing crash triggered a worldwide recession known as the Great Depression. 
The Great Depression 
In the US, factories were  closed and workers sacked. In  the spring of 1933, the agricultural sector was on the verge of disaster: 25 percent of farmers were without work, and many even lost their farms. Unemployment went from 1.5 million in 1929 to 12.8 million,  or 24.75 percent of the workforce,  by 1933, a pattern seen around  the world. 
Unemployment in Britain rose  
to 2.5 million, 25 percent of the workforce, with heavy industry, such as shipbuilding, particularly badly hit. Germany suffered greatly, since its post-war economy was supported by huge American loans which it was unable to pay back. 
A New Deal
The crash helped bring Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt into the  White House in 1932. His policy,  the New Deal, introduced a program of social welfare  for the poor and government expenditure on huge public  projects that created new jobs. 
The Great Depression marked 
the end of the United States’ post-war boom. In Europe many turned to right-wing parties, such as Adolf Hitler’s National Socialist Party  in Germany, with its promise to restore the economy. In many countries, recovery came only  with the increase in employment brought about by World War II.

When fire broke out at the 
Reichstag, the German parliament building,  
just after 9pm on February 27, 1933, Chancellor Adolf Hitler claimed it was a communist plot to bring down the government—a cynical ploy that gave Hitler an excuse to decimate his communist rivals. The timing was perfect: elections were due to take place in March 1933. While Hitler’s National Socialist, or “Nazi,” Party was  
the largest party in parliament, he lacked a working majority because the two next-largest parties (the Social Democrats and Communists) were both on the left, and he feared IN CONTEXT

elections. Hitler rushed to blame  
the fire on a lone Dutch communist, which prompted suspicions that  
the Nazis were behind the arson,  
given that they had so much to gain from discrediting the communists. 
The next day, the Reichstag Fire 
Decree banned the Communist Party. Hitler’s response fed on fears of a communist takeover, and many Germans believed that Hitler’s decisive action had saved the nation. By April, under pressure from the Nazis, the Enabling Act was passed by the Reichstag. This granted Hitler the right to make his own laws without involving the Reichstag, and it solidified his place as a fascist dictator with complete control over Germany. 
Dictators seize power 
Fascism emerged across Europe in the 1920s and 30s. As governments struggled with post-war economic hardship and the fear of communist revolutions, extreme right-wing movements—fascism in Italy and Nazism in Germany—were set up as defenders against communism. They used paramilitary groups to intimidate opponents, and spread propaganda to gain popularity. In Italy, Benito Mussolini was seen as the only man able to restore order. Once appointed prime minister in 1922, Mussolini gradually assumed dictatorial powers, becoming Il Duce , the leader. By 1928, Italy was 
a totalitarian state. 
In Germany, Hitler worked 
ceaselessly to transform the Nazis into a major political force. Relying on a mix of nationalist rhetoric, anti-communism, vicious anti-Semitism, and an unceasing call to reverse the peace terms made at Versailles in 1919, Hitler rode a wave of popularity. In 1933 he became Chancellor, then, shortly after, dictator, calling himself Führer . 
Fascists united 
In 1936 Hitler and Mussolini began to send military support to aid General Franco in the Spanish  Civil War, which pitted right-wing nationalists against left-wing republicans. Franco’s victory against the left-wing Popular  Front government emboldened  the dictators and emphasized the weakness of Western democracies. 
The Reichstag Fire was a key 
moment in Nazi history. It led to the absolute dictatorship of Adolf Hitler and the growth of fascism, setting Europe on the path to world war. 
■ 
Fascism across Europe 
European fascism blossomed in 
a climate of economic disarray in the 1920s and 30s. Democracies lost legitimacy with their people, and fascist parties, offering a form of extreme right-wing nationalism, boasted that they would provide strength where weakness had prevailed. 
In the 1930s, no European 
country, with the exception of the Soviet Union, was without  
a form of fascist party. Britain had Sir Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists (BUF). Ireland had the Blueshirts; France, Le Faisceau; and Denmark and Norway had many far-right parties. Engelbert Dollfuss’s Fatherland Front was installed in Austria in 1934, while Greece was under the rule of General Ioannis Metaxas between 1936 and 1941. Portugal and Bulgaria also came under right-wing dictatorships, as did Romania.
By the end of the 1930s, 
authoritarian governments had assumed power in virtually every corner of central and Eastern Europe, and democracy was in decline. Ours is a fight to the  
finish until communism  
has been absolutely  
uprooted in Germany.

Once appointed prime minister in 1922, Mussolini gradually assumed dictatorial powers, becoming Il Duce , the leader. By 1928, Italy was 
a totalitarian state. 
In Germany, Hitler worked 
ceaselessly to transform the Nazis into a major political force. Relying on a mix of nationalist rhetoric, anti-communism, vicious anti-Semitism, and an unceasing call to reverse the peace terms made at Versailles in 1919, Hitler rode a wave of popularity. In 1933 he became Chancellor, then, shortly after, dictator, calling himself Führer . 
Fascists united 
In 1936 Hitler and Mussolini began to send military support to aid General Franco in the Spanish  Civil War, which pitted right-wing nationalists against left-wing republicans. Franco’s victory against the left-wing Popular  Front government emboldened  the dictators and emphasized the weakness of Western democracies. 
The Reichstag Fire was a key 
moment in Nazi history. It led to the absolute dictatorship of Adolf Hitler and the growth of fascism, setting Europe on the path to world war. 
■ 
Fascism across Europe 
European fascism blossomed in 
a climate of economic disarray in the 1920s and 30s. Democracies lost legitimacy with their people, and fascist parties, offering a form of extreme right-wing nationalism, boasted that they would provide strength where weakness had prevailed. 
In the 1930s, no European 
country, with the exception of the Soviet Union, was without  
a form of fascist party. Britain had Sir Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists (BUF). Ireland had the Blueshirts; France, Le Faisceau; and Denmark and Norway had many far-right parties. Engelbert Dollfuss’s Fatherland Front was installed in Austria in 1934, while Greece was under the rule of General Ioannis Metaxas between 1936 and 1941. Portugal and Bulgaria also came under right-wing dictatorships, as did Romania.
By the end of the 1930s, 
authoritarian governments had assumed power in virtually every corner of central and Eastern Europe, and democracy was in decline. Ours is a fight to the  
finish until communism  
has been absolutely  
uprooted in Germany.

In August 1939, Nazi Germany 
and the Soviet Union signed  a non-aggression pact, also  
secretly agreeing to invade and then divide Poland between them. Russian leader Joseph Stalin had decided that in the event of war, Germany offered the best hope of Soviet security. One week later,  on September 1, 1939, more than  a million German troops invaded Poland from the west. Soon after, on September 17, Russian troops attacked Poland from the east. The context for this unprovoked assault, as declared by the German Führer , 
Adolf Hitler, was the pursuit of Lebensraum , “living space” deemed 
necessary for the expansion of the German people, whom Hitler saw as a superior “Aryan master race,” with the right to displace inferior races.
The invasion lasted just over  
a month. Trapped between two huge, well-armed powers, the Polish air force and army fought valiantly, but they lacked modern aircrafts and tanks. The German Luftwaffe was quickly able to  gain command of the skies. In  the end, Poland’s aviators and soldiers, fighting on two fronts, were overwhelmed. The invasion ended in a resounding victory, and it added to Hitler’s increasing belief that he was a military genius. Some areas in western Poland were absorbed  into Germany, while territory east  
of the River Bug was annexed by  
the Soviet Union. 
The Nazi regime in Poland 
The Nazis imposed a brutal regime on the German part of Poland.  Hitler was bent on the elimination of anyone who stood in the way of German domination. 
As part of Hitler’s plan for  
ethnic cleansing, around 5 million Polish Jews were rounded up  and herded into ghettos. The invasion of Poland gave some forewarning of the violence that would soon be visited upon  scores of countries and countless people around the globe. 
The rise of the Nazi Party

In March 1938, Hitler annexed Austria to Germany, before setting his sights on the German-speaking part of Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland. British and French politicians wanted to avoid a repeat of the horrors of World War I and felt  
that the Sudetenland was not  
worth fighting for. In the Munich Agreement of September 29, 1938, the Sudetenland was handed to Hitler in exchange for his promise to end his land-grabs.

The West intervenes
Hitler’s invasion of Poland, which 
began on September 1, 1939, finally forced Britain and France into  
a war they had been trying desperately to avoid. Deciding  
that they needed to take a tougher stance against Hitler after his takeover of Czechoslovakia, the  two nations had guaranteed Poland support in the event of German aggression. Honoring this promise, they declared war on Germany on September 3, which meant British and French colonies were also drawn into conflict: Britain’s dominions Australia and New Zealand declared war immediately, the Union of South Africa followed on September 6, and Canada on September 10. 
Germany quickly overran 
Poland with its tactic of blitzkrieg  
(“lightning war”), which utilized tank divisions supported by the Luftwaffe, the German air force. The British sent an Expeditionary Force (BEF) to France, but neither Britain nor France attempted  
an offensive against Germany. They were not ready for a large-scale attack, and some politicians still believed that peace terms could be negotiated.
This period became known as 
the “Phoney War.” Expecting to be bombed, Britain began to evacuate its children from major cities. Air-raid shelters were built, and gas masks handed out. The Phoney War ended in April 1940, when Germany attacked and conquered Denmark and Norway. A month later, they turned on France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The French army was poorly led and badly equipped. France had relied on the Maginot Line, a chain of fortresses along the frontier with Germany, to halt any attack. But the fortification did not extend along the Franco-Belgian border, and the Germans simply bypassed it at the north end. Within the space of six weeks, France had fallen to the German onslaught.
The Battle of Britain
Only a hesitation by Hitler, who may have wanted to rest his troops and spare them from a possible counterattack, prevented the destruction of British forces before NAZI INVASION OF POLAND
Operation Dynamo , in June 1940, 
focused on the evacuation of Allied 
soldiers from the port of Dunkirk,  in France, after they had become surrounded by German troops.they could be evacuated by sea 
from Dunkirk. Thousands of Allied soldiers were transferred across  the Channel in all kinds of vessels in Operation Dynamo. Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty and later Britain’s wartime prime minister, told the British parliament, “The Battle of France is over. I expect the Battle  of Britain is about to begin.” 
However, Hitler’s attempts  
to invade Britain in Operation Sea Lion had to be abandoned  after the Luftwaffe failed to win  the battle of the skies. With the Luftwaffe triumphant in both Poland and France, the Germans had hoped that Britain could  be beaten by air power alone. However, German crews were exhausted, intelligence was poor, and Britain’s use of radar enabled the Royal Air Force (RAF) to track incoming planes and take off in time to meet an attack. The Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940 We shall defend our island 
whatever the cost may be.  
We shall fight on beaches, 
landing grounds, in fields,  
in streets, and on the hills.  
We shall never surrender.

was the first real check on Hitler’s progress, but Britain alone could not fight a power that now had control of almost the entire continent.
The world at war
What started as a European war gradually became a world war. In June 1940, Italy, emboldened by German successes, declared war on Britain and France, fulfilling  the terms of the Axis agreement made between Hitler and Mussolini on May 22, 1939. But Italy’s failures in Greece and North Africa  forced Hitler to send German armies into these areas, as well  as Yugoslavia.
On September 7, 1940 Germany 
began its first major air raid on London. The Blitz, as the bombing of the English capital became known, thrust civilians into the war and put relentless pressure on industry, ports, and British morale. With men joining the army, women were required to work in factories and on farms. Food rationing was introduced in Britain in January 1940, and  people were urged to grow their own food. Nazi-occupied Europe also experienced food shortages, which weighed most heavily on  the conquered populations. 
Collaboration or exile
In some locations, the Germans worked with existing governments and fully supported puppet administrations, such as the pro-Nazi Vidkun Quisling in Norway and the Vichy regime in southern France. Led by Marshal Philippe Pétain, Vichy was officially neutral, but it collaborated closely with Germany, fighting the French resistance, and implementing  anti-Semitic legislation. 
Germany had total control in 
Poland and eventual control of the Baltic states. Monarchs and politicians of more than a dozen occupied countries escaped to Britain. Polish ministers set up headquarters in London, and Belgium’s government operations were transferred there. The  Dutch royal family, under Queen THE MODERN WORLD
Wilhelmina, also sought refuge  
in London. When France fell to Germany, Charles de Gaulle,  who opposed the newly installed Vichy government, became the voice of French opposition to the  
Nazi occupation. 
In 1940 the biggest threat  
facing Britain was from German U-boats. As an island, Britain was dependent on its merchant ships to bring in vital supplies but also to export equipment to its fighting forces abroad, and German U-boats were sinking dozens of Allied  ships each month. Merchant ships traveled in convoy to increase  the chances of supplies getting through on each journey, but casualties were high.
Fighting the USSR
In June 1941, Britain gained a  new ally when Germany invaded the USSR in Operation Barbarossa. Hitler had looked to the Soviet Union for new territory for the German people. It would also remove any future threat from the east but

hardships. German tanks plowed 
through the Red Army defenses. Prisoners of war were shot or left  to starve. Fleeing civilians were butchered without a moment’s hesitation. The harshness of the Russian winter slowed the Germans, and Russian counterattacks drove back their front line by several hundred miles. In the Battle  of Moscow, from early October  1941 to January 1942, an estimated 650,000 soldiers from the Soviet Army lost their lives. In the spring of 1942, the Germans resumed their offensive in the USSR, driving the Red Army back and coming close to taking the Russian oilfields.
The Pacific and Africa
In December 1941, Japan entered the war by attacking the US fleet  
at Pearl Harbor, in the Hawaiian Islands, as part of its plan to drive American forces out of the Pacific. Germany—which had a tripartite agreement with Japan and Italy to provide mutual military assistance in the event any one of them was attacked by a nation not already involved in the war—immediately declared war on the United States. Britain now had two strong allies, the USSR under Joseph Stalin, and the US, led by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Both were decisive in bringing about the defeat of the Axis powers. American industry became a triumph of wartime production, giving Americans in combat in Europe and Asia the tools they needed to fight the Axis.
Japan won quick victories in  
the Pacific. It successfully captured  the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Indonesia, and Singapore, Britain’s main naval base in East Asia. 
In North Africa, meanwhile,  
a renewed Axis offensive led by General Erwin Rommel brought  the German and Italian armies within striking distance of Cairo and the Suez Canal. The first major Allied victory came in Egypt. In July 1942, Rommel was halted at El Alamein; in October, he was forced into retreat by the British 8th Army,  led by Field Marshal Montgomery. 
That same winter, the Red Army 
defeated the Nazis at Stalingrad. The Soviets encircled the Germans, forcing a surrender in February 1943. 
History knows no greater 
display of courage than  
that shown by the people  
of the Soviet Union.
Henry L. Stimson
US Secretary of Warfundamentally followed through on Hitler’s plan to destroy communism. At first it looked as if Germany and its allies would be as successful against the Russians as it had  been against the French. By winter, Germany had advanced to within  1 mile (1.5km) of Moscow, and Leningrad, the USSR’s second city, was under siege. 
Another powerful rationale for 
war in the east was one based on racist ideology and Hitler’s hatred of Slavs and Jews. As German troops swept into Russia, they inflicted  a terrible campaign of genocide against communists and Jews. Russian troops endured extreme Operation Barbarossa , launched  
in June 1941, saw the invasion of the 
Soviet Union by Germany, in breach  of the non-aggression pact the two countries had signed two years earlier.
General Dwight D. Eisenhower led the Allied forces during the Normandy landings of June 1944. The invasion was a decisive step toward taking Europe back from the Nazis.

Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki
American planes dropped 
atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to force Japan to surrender and end World War II. On August 6, 1945, “Little Boy” was dropped on Hiroshima. The inhabitants below had no idea what was about to happen. People, animals, and buildings were incinerated in the searing heat. Some 70,000 died immediately. Despite this terrible event, Japan did not surrender. 
Japan had cause to 
reconsider its position when the Soviets entered the war against them by crossing  
into Manchuria on August 9. When, that same afternoon, the US dropped “Fat Man”  
on Nagasaki, instantly killing 50,000, Japan was brought to its knees and agreed to the Allies’ terms of surrender. These unprecedented attacks avoided a bloody ground assault by the Allies on the Japanese mainland, but many thousands lost their lives as a result of the long-term effects of radiation sickness.THE MODERN WORLD
The turn of the tide
In a conference at Tehran in 
November 1943, the Allied leaders agreed on a strategy to liberate Europe. While the Russians drove the Germans back in the east, and the British and Americans advanced slowly through Italy, a huge Allied invasion force arrived in Normandy in June 1944. Eleven months later, it had reached the river Elbe in northern Germany, while Russian troops were advancing block by block through Berlin. Germany  was being hit repeatedly by British Lancaster bomber aircraft from Bomber Command and the US Eighth Air Force. Staring at defeat, Hitler committed suicide on April 30, and Germany surrendered unconditionally a week later.
The last act of the war came  
in August 1945, when the US,  after fighting island by island through the Pacific, put an end to Japanese resistance by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima  and Nagasaki. The effects of the bombs were cataclysmic, inflicting unprecedented horror on the two Japanese cities. 
Nations united
Hitler’s invasion of Poland marked the start of World War II, the largest and most destructive war in history, by the end of which an estimated 60 million people had been killed. Like their predecessors in 1918, the Allies were determined that this should be the last war of its kind. 
Representatives of 50 nations 
met in 1945 to set up the United Nations. There was hope that this would mark the start of a new era  of international understanding.

troops fight against Japan’s Imperial Army for possession of the tiny island in the Pacific Ocean, resulting in 100,000 Japanese casualties.

Hitler’s invasion of Poland marked the start of World War II, the largest and most destructive war in history, by the end of which an estimated 60 million people had been killed. Like their predecessors in 1918, the Allies were determined that this should be the last war of its kind. 
Representatives of 50 nations 
met in 1945 to set up the United Nations. There was hope that this would mark the start of a new era  of international understanding.

 THE FINAL SOLUTION 
OF THE JEWISH 
QUESTION
 THE WANNSEE CONFERENCE ( 1942)
On January 20, 1942, 15 
members of the Nazi Party and German officials met 
in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee  to discuss the implementation  of the “Final Solution of the Jewish Quest ion”—the code name for the 
systematic annihilation of European Jews. During the conference, a tabulation of all the Jews in Europe was presented, country by country, as well as a target number for extermination: 11 million. The meeting lasted two hours and was matter-of-fact and dispassionate. After approving the “Final Solution” and the slaughter of the Jews, the men called for brandy and cigars. IN CONTEXT

The Wannsee Conference was far 
from the start of Nazi brutality against Jews. Adolf Hitler had come to power in 1933, spreading his belief that Germans were the Aryan master race, superior to all others, and that their blood should not be contaminated. He identified Jews as a race of people, not just  a religious group. German Jews were banned from marrying non-Jewish Germans and subjected  to increasing discrimination and segregation. From the time of the German takeover of Austria in 1938, Nazi brutality against Jews worsened. Jews wanting to flee German rule found other countries unwilling to accept them. 
Gathering momentum
After Germany’s invasion of Poland in 1939, the Nazi campaign against the Jews reached a terrifying new level. Herded into ghettoes, Polish Jews began to die in large numbers of starvation and ill-treatment. When Germany invaded Russia in 1941, paramilitary death squads carried out mass killings of Jews in the conquered areas. To start with, victims were shot, up to 30,000 at a time, but the SS then began gassing Jews in the backs of vans. Poison gas was found to be a more efficient way to commit mass murder. 
Until 1941, the Nazi leadership 
had envisaged solving the “Jewish problem” by deporting Jews to a distant location. By the time of the Wannsee Conference, however, they were committed to systematically killing Europe’s Jewish population. Six dedicated death camps were built in Poland. Adolf Eichmann of the Nazi paramilitary corps, the SS, arranged the transport of Jews to the camps from right across Europe, including France, Greece, Hungary, and Italy. The Jews from the Polish ghettos were also taken there to be exterminated. Prisoners arrived at these huge killing factories by train and were gassed in shower rooms, their corpses burned in large crematoria. At the Belzec camp, about half a million Jews were killed, and only seven prisoners are known to have survived. The death camp at Auschwitz, however, also had a labor camp attached, where those who were not killed on arrival were made to work. The Germans needed slave labor to support their war effort, and this offered Jews their best chance of survival. Along with other prisoners—including socialists, homosexuals, Roma, and prisoners of war—many Jews were sent to concentration camps. Their heads were shaved, and they were given a uniform to strip them of their identity. When the Allies liberated the camps in 1945, they found a vision of hell. The survivors were skeletal and traumatized.
State-sanctioned genocide
The Wannsee Protocol, the minutes of the conference, represents the unimaginable. For the first time, a modern state had committed itself to the murder of an entire people. As many as 6 million Jews lost their lives, and an estimated 5.5 million others—Slavs, homosexuals, communists—were also killed.

The Nuremberg Trials 
After the end of World War II, 
the Allies sought to bring the Nazis to justice. An international tribunal was held at Nuremberg, Germany, beginning in 1945. Newsreels captured from  
the Nazis revealed the gas chambers, the massacre of civilians, and the ill-treatment  
of prisoners. The trials were televised, showing to the  
world—and, in particular the German people—evidence of  
the horrors that had taken place in the concentration camps.Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, and Joseph Goebbels, head of propaganda, had committed suicide, leaving 24 defendants facing four counts: crimes against peace, planning and waging wars of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Most said they were “only obeying orders.” Albert Speer, head of war production, was jailed for 20 years, while  
12 of the other defendants were sentenced to death; the trials led to the setting up of a permanent international criminal court in The Hague, in the Netherlands.

 THE BERLIN AIRLIFT (1948)
At the Yalta and Potsdam 
conferences in 1945, the wartime Allies agreed to 
split defeated Germany into four zones, each separately administered by France, Britain, the USSR, and the US. The capital, Berlin, lay deep within Soviet-controlled East Germany. This, too, was split into four zones. On June 24, 1948, the Soviet Union imposed a blockade on West Berlin, cutting off all links by rail, road, and canal, to prevent vital supplies from reaching the population. In all, 2.5 million people faced a choice between starvation and accepting a communist regime. A clash between East and West had the potential to lead to another world war, but the Western nations devised a plan to use airplanes  to drop supplies into Berlin. Over the next 14 months, 278,288 relief missions were flown to the city.  At the height of the airlift, a plane landed every three minutes.
The Cold War 
The era of cooperation between the victors of World War II was short-lived; the Western countries clashed with the Soviet Union (USSR), over the type of governments being set up in Europe. The USSR banned non-communist parties in every Eastern European country and created a block of satellite states subservient to Soviet leadership. The Western powers sought to create democracies that excluded communists from power. Germany remained divided into communist East and democratic West, an emblem of polarized Europe. In 1946, former British prime minister Winston Churchill summed up the situation when he stated that “an iron curtain has descended across the continent.”This deep division between East and West became known as the Cold War, since it

A plan to starve Berlin 
In June 1948, the three Western Allies announced plans to merge their zones and introduce a new currency. Stalin’s response was swift: his blockade sought to  starve Berlin into surrender  and wrest power away from the  West. The Western powers did  not want to give the Soviets  control of the Western sector  and were determined to stay. 
The Berlin Airlift was a success, 
and Stalin lifted the blockade in May 1949. Spurred by the Berlin crisis, Western European countries formed a defensive alliance—the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The communist states of Eastern Europe organized a rival alliance in the Warsaw Pact in 1955.
The crisis over Berlin 
exacerbated the animosity between the US and the USSR. After World War II, Korea had also been split—into a Soviet-occupied northern zone and an American-occupied southern one. The north, backed by the USSR, invaded  the south in June 1950. The US provided troops for a United Nations army, which went to the support of the South Koreans.  The Korean War ended in 1953,  but it, the conflict over Berlin, and the Soviet testing of their first atomic bomb in 1949, created a climate of fear in the West over communist expansion.

Mohandas Gandhi 
The Indian national leader 
known as Mahatma, meaning “great soul,” Mohandas Gandhi (1869–1948) led his country to independence  
from Great Britain. He came from a Hindu family and studied law in England before spending 20 years in South Africa trying to secure rights for the Indians living there.
Gandhi’s involvement  
in Indian politics began in 1919, and he soon became the unquestioned leader of the independence movement.  
He preached the doctrine  
of Satyagraha (soul force,  
or passive resistance) which he applied against the British with great effect. He adopted a simple life believing in the virtue of small communities and campaigned against Indian industrialization. 
Gandhi’s life work was 
crowned in 1947, when India finally won independence,

to his assassination the following year by a Hindu fanatic, who blamed him for the partition of India, although Gandhi himself bitterly opposed the dismemberment of the subcontinent.

parliament where power was 
shared between Indians and British officials. This did not satisfy Indian nationalists, and the British responded to their protests with sometimes brutal repression. 
The push for independence  
from the 1920s to the 1940s  
was galvanized by the work of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Gandhi not only launched the Satyagraha campaign, promoting non-violent protest, but also became an influential figure for millions of followers. In 1942 Gandhi led the “Quit India” campaign, calling  for civil disobedience to disrupt Britain’s efforts in World War II. The British immediately jailed Gandhi and other nationalist leaders. 
By the end of World War II, it 
was clear that Britain lacked the means to defeat the nationalist campaign. Britain’s officials in India were utterly exhausted, and Britain itself was almost bankrupt. Britain agreed to a fully independent India. While Gandhi and Nehru advocated Indian unity, the Muslim League, founded in 1906 to safeguard the rights of Muslims, demanded a completely separate Muslim state. Its leader, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, feared that Muslims could not protect their minority rights if left  
to live under Hindu rule. Congress rejected the proposal and violence on the streets between Hindus  
and Muslims began to escalate. 
Pakistan is born
In 1947, Lord Louis Mountbatten flew into Delhi as Britain’s final Viceroy of India. Faced with irreconcilable differences over the demand for a separate state for India’s Muslims, he persuaded all parties to agree to partitioning  the country into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan. 
From its birth, Pakistan faced 
many challenges. It had limited resources and a huge refugee problem. There were different traditions, cultures, and languages, and Jinnah, its first governor general, died the following year.  
In 1948, India and Pakistan fought over Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority area to remain within India. INDIAN INDEPENDENCE AND PARTITION
India’s independence was finally 
declared by Jawaharlal Nehru and  Lord Louis Mountbatten at Delhi’s Constituent Assembly, just seconds into August 15, 1947.Colonies gain freedom
After World War II, the European 
colonial powers—mainly Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal—recognized that change was inevitable. Some colonies won independence by peaceful means, such as in Burma and Ceylon (1948), but often, European powers tried to hold on to their colonies. 
During World War II, Japan, itself 
a significant imperial power, drove the European powers out of Asia. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, nationalist movements in the former Asian colonies campaigned for independence rather than a return to European colonial rule.  
Dr. Ahmed Sukarno, leader of Indonesia’s nationalist movement, declared the Independent Republic of Indonesia in 1945. The Dutch sent troops to restore their authority, and in two military campaigns that followed, an estimated 150,000 Indonesians and 5,000 Dutch soldiers died. International pressure eventually forced the Dutch to concede independence in 1949.Ours is not a drive for  
power, but purely a  
non-violent fight for  
India’s independence.

Britain responded by declaring a state of emergency and pursuing a bitter campaign against Chinese “communist terrorists.” Independence was not granted  to Malaya until 1957. 
Unrest in Africa
In Kenya, the imposition of a state of emergency in 1952, in response to the Mau Mau (rebel) uprising,  led to greater insurgency and the British rounding up of tens of thousands of Mau Mau suspects into detention camps. By 1956 the rebellion had been crushed, but the methods used by the British to regain control brought international condemnation. In central Africa, too, decolonization was born in violence. In Rhodesia, savage conflict erupted between the black majority and the fiercely racist white leadership, which had unilaterally declared independence in 1965.The process of decolonization coincided with the new Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States. The US became concerned that, as the European powers lost their colonies, Soviet-supported communist parties might achieve power in the new states. The US used substantial aid packages to encourage newly independent nations to adopt governments that aligned with the West. The Soviet Union deployed similar tactics in an effort to encourage new nations to join the communist bloc. Many resisted the pressure to be drawn into the Cold War and joined the “non-aligned movement.” This movement began out of a 1955 meeting in Bandung, Indonesia, involving 29 African and Asian countries. Member countries decided they would not be involved in alliances or defense pacts with the main world powers, but focus on internal development instead. 
Terrorism in France
France was determined to maintain its political status in Algeria. When independence was not realized after World War II,  war broke out between Algerian nationalists and French settlers. In 1958 the National Liberation Front (FLN), the main nationalist group, led several terrorist attacks, first in Algeria, then in Paris. The crisis led to the return to power of Charles  de Gaulle, the wartime leader of the Free French. In 1960, de Gaulle, to the horror of the French settlers, agreed to emancipate Algeria. After a long and bloody conflict in which an estimated 150,000 died, Algeria gained its independence in 1962.
Independence gained
During the 1960s and 70s, many  of the countries that were once  held as British colonies became THE MODERN WORLD
independent states and joined  the Commonwealth. The British Commonwealth, formed in 1931, became the successor to Britain’s old empire, preserving Britain’s global economic and political influence. In 1931 Britain extended dominion status to the already self-governing colonies of Canada (1867), Australia (1901), New Zealand (1907), and Newfoundland (1907). Britain and her dominions shared equal status, and they accepted the British monarch as head of the Commonwealth. In 1949 the British Commonwealth became “The Commonwealth,” a free and equal association of independent states, but the end of the empire was drawing near. Britain fought a war to retain the Falkland Islands in 1982, and Hong Kong continued as a British dependency until 1997. 
Gandhi had a profound 
influence on world politics. Other peaceful resisters—such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Tibet’s Dalai Lama—emulated his methods. Around the world, the struggle for countries to secede from nations they belong to continues, as the likes of Scotland (United Kingdom), Quebec (Canada), and Palestine fight to be seen as nations in  their own right.

struggle, of tears, of fire,

A troubled land
Jews had immigrated to Palestine to avoid persecution in Europe since the 1880s, believing it to be the  
land promised to them by God. With the Balfour Declaration in 1917, the British government supported a Jewish homeland. The majority-Arab population objected to the settlers’ claim on their country. Facing increasing attacks, the Jews formed local defense groups under the umbrella term the Haganah. 
Escalation of violence
In 1939, the rise of anti-Semitism  in Europe, particularly in Nazi Germany, forced Jews to flee to Jerusalem. Facing a much larger influx of settlers than they had anticipated, the British proposed  a restriction on the free settlement of Jewish refugees in Palestine. 
After World War II, violence in 
Palestine escalated, and in 1947 the British government said it would terminate its rule and hand the “Palestine problem” to the United Nations. The Holocaust convinced the UN that the Jewish people needed a homeland, so they resolved to partition Palestine into an area for Arabs (about 44 percent) and the rest for a Jewish state. The Jews agreed with the plan, but the Arabs refused it. Despite this, on May 14, 1948 the state of Israel was born. 
Israel’s immediate priority was to 
build a credible defense force from the Haganah. After the Six Day War (1967), Israel controlled the Sinai, Gaza, the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and Jerusalem. It faced many attacks from Arab neighbors, in addition to threats from the paramilitary Palestine Liberation Army (PLO), formed in 1964. 
Arab Palestinians repeatedly 
called for an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza. In the occupied zones, they suffered from poor living conditions, military raids, and restricted movement.

 THE LONG MARCH (1934–1935)
In the autumn of 1933, the 
Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  was on the brink of 
annihilation. Nationalists had taken control of the country and  launched 
a major attack against their base in Jiangxi, a southeastern province.  In October 1934, the C ommunists 
were forced to abandon their stronghold and break through the Nationalist blockade. Some 80,000 set out on an extraordinary journey of 3,700 miles  (6,000km) that  lasted 
368 days. It became known as the Long March.

The Tibetan mountains, Gobi 
Desert, and miles of wilderness stood between them and their  goal: to reach the safety of  northern China and establish a  new Communist base. Hundreds  died of starvation: of the original  80,000 marchers, only about 8,000 survived. Far from being viewed as a failure, however, their feat was hailed as a triumph of endurance and ensured the survival of the CCP. 
Unifying the nation 
In 1895, China had suffered a heavy military defeat against Japan. Anti-Japanese feeling swelled following Japan’s aggression against China during World War I. Huge protests erupted after the 1919 Treaty of Versailles handed former German colonies in China to Japan. In the wake of these protests, communist ideals gained support, and in  1921 the CCP was founded. The Kuomintang, a Nationalist party, also grew and by the mid-1920s  had begun unifying the country. 
Massacre in Shanghai 
Nationalists joined forces with Communists in 1926 under Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi) in the Northern Expedition to regain territories controlled by regional warlords. During the expedition,  as the CCP increased in strength,  a bitter rivalry led to an attack by Nationalists against the CCP in Shanghai, in April 1927. Hundreds of Communists were arrested and tortured. The massacre triggered years of anti-Communist violence, and the Communists retreated to the Jiangxi countryside. 
The struggle for survival 
After the Long March, the CCP regrouped in the north. Nationalists and Communists were forced into an uneasy alliance in 1937, when Japan invaded China. By 1939, large areas in the north and east had been conquered. After Japan’s defeat in World War II, tension between Nationalists and Communists flared up again, leading to civil war in 1946. The Communists won after massive battles with more than half a million troops on either side. On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong created the People’s Republic of China. 
The Long March was a feat  
of remarkable endurance. To the survivors, it provided a deep sense of mission and contributed to the perception of Mao as a leader of destiny and revolutionary struggle.

Chiang Kai-shek The foremost non-communist 
Chinese leader of the 20th century, Chiang Kai-shek (1887–1975) was a soldier who, in 1925, became leader of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party), which had been founded by Sun Yat-sen. 
During his various stints as 
China’s premier, he ruled over a troubled country. He attempted modest reforms but was beset  
by intractable domestic strife,  
as well as by armed conflict with Japanese invaders. 
Despite making attempts to 
crush his chief rivals, the Chinese Communists, when China was attacked by Japan his followers forced him to make an alliance with the Communists against the invading Japanese. The alliance did not survive the end of the World War II, and in 1949 Chiang and his party were driven from the mainland to the island of Formosa, which by  
that time had become known  
to Westerners as Taiwan. While he was there, Chiang set up a government in exile, which he controlled until his death in 1975. His government was recognized by many states as China’s legitimate government.

The European powers that ruled 
Africa had been impoverished by World War II, and attitudes to colonialism were changing. Nations that had fought against fascism found it hard to justify imperialism.

Events in Ghana had a significant impact in West Africa. In 1958, Guinea voted to secede from France. Determined not to be left behind, Nigeria celebrated independence from Britain on October 1, 1960.  By 1964, independence had also been granted to Kenya, Northern Rhodesia (Zambia), Nyasaland (Malawi), and Uganda. The French fought an eight-year  war to hold on to Algeria, finally conceding independence in 1962. 
The Portuguese, the first 
European colonial power in Africa, fought a long war to hold on to their colonies of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea from 1961 to 1974. The collapse of Belgian authority in  the Congo in 1960 led to a wave  of violence across the nation and the assassination of the first prime minister, Patrick Lumumba, in 1961. Many African countries gained independence during the Cold  War. Used as pawns between  the capitalist and communist superpowers, they accepted loans and military aid: in the 1970s, Ethiopia was rewarded with billions of dollars’ worth of Soviet military equipment. Civil wars were also numerous, such as the ethnic civil wars in Rwanda and Zaire, as well as the clashes between warlords over food supplies in Somalia.
Dictatorial rulers
Once independence was achieved, African nationalist leaders sought to consolidate power by banning political rivals. Coups and military governments predominated—such as that of Idi Amin in Uganda. By the early 1970s, only Zimbabwe and South Africa were still ruled by the white political elite. Corruption, however, existed in most African countries. Nkrumah wanted Ghana to be a beacon of success, but his Pan-Africanism failed, and Ghana’s fortunes began to slide as he became increasingly dictatorial.

Kwame Nkrumah
Ambitious and well-educated, 
Kwame Nkrumah had big plans for both Ghana and Africa as a whole. He went to college in the US and later traveled to England, where he became involved in the West African Students’ Union. In 1948, he began traveling around the Gold Coast as leader of a youth movement calling for “self-government now.” 
Nkrumah’s calls for positive 
action civil disobedience as head of the Convention People’s Party led to his arrest, and he was sentenced to three years in  
jail. While in prison, he won  
the general election, and five years later, in 1957, he became prime minister of the newly independent Ghana.
Nkrumah’s popularity rose 
with the construction of new schools, roads, and health facilities, but by 1964 Ghana was a one-party state and Nkrumah its “life president.” After two assassination attempts and increasing human-rights abuses, Nkrumah faced a coup in 1966 and went into exile in Guinea. He died of cancer in 1972.

Ambitious and well-educated, 
Kwame Nkrumah had big plans for both Ghana and Africa as a whole. He went to college in the US and later traveled to England, where he became involved in the West African Students’ Union. In 1948, he began traveling around the Gold Coast as leader of a youth movement calling for “self-government now.” 
Nkrumah’s calls for positive 
action civil disobedience as head of the Convention People’s Party led to his arrest, and he was sentenced to three years in  
jail. While in prison, he won  
the general election, and five years later, in 1957, he became prime minister of the newly independent Ghana.
Nkrumah’s popularity rose 
with the construction of new schools, roads, and health facilities, but by 1964 Ghana was a one-party state and Nkrumah its “life president.” After two assassination attempts and increasing human-rights abuses, Nkrumah faced a coup in 1966 and went into exile in Guinea. He died of cancer in 1972.

 THE CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS (1962)
For 13 days, from October 15 
to October 28, 1962, the world teetered on the edge 
of nuclear destruction. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had deployed nuclear weapons in Cuba, and  US president John F. Kennedy demanded he remove them.  Each threatened nuclear war. This was no empty threat: from the 1950s, both superpowers had begun stockpiling vast nuclear arsenals. Strategists articulated the mutually assured destruction (MAD) doctrine, which held that if Russia attacked the West, the West would make sure that they retaliate. In short, there would be no winners.IN CONTEXT

When Kennedy became president 
in 1961, he inherited a deteriorating relationship with Cuba. The US  and Cuba had a history of mutual cooperation, but this had changed with the Cuban Revolution, when, on January 1, 1959, Fidel Castro overthrew the government of President General Fulgencio Batista. 
Trade embargo
The US accepted Castro as ruler of Cuba, in spite of his communist leanings, and had a large economic presence in Cuba. However, Castro began to break the American hold on the economy, nationalizing all industry without compensation.  In response, the US imposed a sweeping trade embargo, so  Castro turned to the Soviet Union for support. Fearing communist expansion, the US tried to topple Cuba’s government with the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961, involving CIA-backed Cuban exiles. 
Also in 1961, the US deployed  
15 nuclear-tipped Jupiter missiles in Turkey, in readiness to strike against the USSR should the need arise. Turkey shared a border with the Soviet Union, so this was viewed as a direct threat to Soviet territory. 
An ultimatum 
Khrushchev came under pressure from Soviet hard-liners to take a tough stance. This, and the desire to defend his Cuban ally from American aggression, led him to install missiles in Cuba that were capable of carrying nuclear warheads. On October 14, 1962, photographs taken by a U-2 spy plane showed nuclear weapon  
sites being built by the Soviets. Kennedy’s military advisers sought an immediate attack on the missile sites, but Kennedy favored a naval blockade of Cuba to prevent the installation of more missiles. He issued an ultimatum to Khrushchev to withdraw and informed the world that nuclear war was an imminent possibility. Meanwhile, Khrushchev ordered the captains of Soviet ships to hold their course for Cuban ports. 
Breaking the deadlock 
Frantic diplomacy behind the scenes led to a deal that broke the deadlock: Kennedy agreed to remove missiles from Turkey in secret if Khrushchev dismantled all nuclear weapons in Cuba. The Soviet leader agreed—only if America would also abort its plan to invade Cuba. 
On October 28, Khrushchev 
ordered his ships to turn around— a defining moment of the Cold  War. The superpowers became more cautious, and the threat of nuclear war began to diminish.

KennedyThe 35th president of the US,  
John Fitzgerald Kennedy (1917–63) 
was the first Roman Catholic  
and, at 43, the youngest man  
ever to be elected to that office. As president, Kennedy brought  
a fresh and youthful style to politics, calling his program  
the “New Frontier.” This included  
a challenge to venture into outer space and to eliminate poverty. His administration quickly won popular support. 
Kennedy’s years in power were 
marked in foreign affairs by Cold War tension. His greatest test was the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, where his firm stance against Russia brought him even greater popularity. His ambitious domestic reforms, however,  
on issues such as welfare and civil rights, were increasingly blocked by Congress. 
While he was campaigning 
for the next presidential election, JFK was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. Kennedy’s death was a shock and a tragedy for Americans, at a time when tensions were just starting to ease between the United States and Russia.

launched the world’s first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1 . 
Carrying a simple radio transmitter to relay information about conditions in space, the satellite remained in orbit until January 4, 1958, when  
it re-entered and burned up in Earth’s atmosphere. 
Sputnik  symbolized far more 
than a scientific breakthrough.  
It was a sensational coup for the Soviets during the Cold War with the West. No shots were fired,  
but the military and political ramifications were immense. Americans felt more vulnerable  
to a nuclear attack. The USSR was now a Superpower, stunning the US and initiating the “space race,”  
a frantic competition between nations for technological superiority. 
The US catches up
Sputnik  was a mass-media event 
that ushered in the “Space Age,” capturing the world’s collective imagination. There was a boom  
in science-fiction books, films, and  
TV dramas set in space. By 1958,  the US had created NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, but they could only watch in envy as the Soviets sent Yuri Gagarin into orbit in 1961, the first human to go to outer space. 
The US caught up by sending 
John Glenn into orbit in 1962, and by 1967 they had built a rocket, Saturn V , that was powerful enough 
to reach the moon. In 1969, 12 years after the launch of Sputnik 1 , the 
American astronaut Neil Armstrong left Apollo 11  and became the first  
man to walk on the moon.

Calls for equality
The abolishment of slavery after  
the American Civil War of 1861–65 led to emancipated slaves seeking American citizenship. However, while they were no longer slaves, they were not equal with whites, and they endured discrimination, segregation, and violent racist attacks. In the 1950s, a number of African-American groups fought back against discrimination with a policy of non-violence. In the 1960s, civil rights marches in Birmingham, Alabama, led by King were central to the campaign. Some extremists, especially in the South, reacted with gruesome acts of violence. 
After the March on Washington , 
US Congress passed the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, outlawing discrimination, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. More than half

After French colonial rule came to an end in 1954, Vietnam was divided at the Geneva Conference into North Vietnam, with a communist government under Vietnamese communist revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh, and the US-backed South Vietnam.

superpowers Russia and China,  
set up the National Liberation  Front (NLF) in South Vietnam, and started a guerrilla war to unite the country under communist rule. 
Tensions steadily rose until 1964. 
In August of that year, the US Navy destroyer Maddox  was operating  
off the coast of North Vietnam in  
the Gulf of Tonkin, monitoring radar and radio from northern coastal installations, to support attacks made by the South Vietnamese navy. North Vietnam, believing the Maddox  was linked to raids on its 
coastal targets, launched a torpedo attack. Two days later, the Maddox  
reported once again coming under fire. This second attack has since been disputed, but US president Lyndon B. Johnson, recognizing that South Vietnam could not prevail on its own against a communist-led guerrilla movement that already controlled much of the country, used the skirmish to pass the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in Congress. This allowed him to take any measures necessary to deal with threats to  US forces in Southeast Asia. 
US intervention
The US feared that if Vietnam became a communist regime, other countries in the region would soon follow. Using the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Johnson poured troops into the South and bombed North Vietnam by air. Huge numbers of civilians were killed, but despite their technological superiority, the Americans failed to crush the Viet Cong guerrillas. American troops suffered high casualties and gradually became demoralized. 
The specter of communism
The Vietnam War was the first televised war in US history. As  the public watched horrific events unfolding, an increasing number opposed the conflict. Around the world, peace movements organized large anti-war demonstrations. 
The communists’ Tet Offensive 
of 1968, a series of fierce attacks on more than 100 cities and towns in South Vietnam, crushed US hopes of an imminent end to the conflict, and peace talks were initiated in 1969. In March 1973, the last American troops withdrew from Vietnam, and in April 1975  South Vietnam fell to the North. 
US policy-makers consistently 
misinterpreted Asian nationalist movements for Soviet-inspired communism. Ultimately, however, what the US feared never came to pass, and with the exception of Laos and Cambodia, the region remained out of communist control. 
■Pol Pot’s brutal regime
During the Vietnam War, North 
Vietnam used Cambodia to channel soldiers and supplies  
to the South along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. In 1970, a joint US–South Vietnamese force invaded Cambodia to flush out the  
Viet Cong. The US also heavily bombed Cambodia. The military destabilization in Cambodia led to a surge of support for Pol Pot, the leader of the Kampuchean Communist Party, or Khmer Rouge, a guerrilla movement that seized power in 1975. Pol Pot’s brutal regime intended to style the country into a classless agrarian society inspired by Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution in China. The entire population was marched to the countryside and forced to work as rice farmers. Over the next 44 months, around 2 million people—a quarter of Cambodia’s population—died, either killed or starved. The fields where people died became known as the “Killing Fields”. After three years of terror, Pol Pot was driven from power by  
a Vietnamese invasion.

regime and replace it with one  
more open  to American interests. 
Eight  American B-26 bombers flew 
from Nicaragua to destroy Castro’s air force on the ground. The air raid seemed success ful, but at least six  
of Castro’s fighter planes survived. The next day, Castro’s air force sank two ships loaded with vital supplies. In the early hours of April 17, a group of around 1,400 Cuban exiles, codenamed Brigade 2506, launched an amphibious assault on the coast of southern Cuba, the Bay of Pigs. They were driven back by Castro’s forces and ran out of ammunition.  It only took three days to thwart  the exiles’ invasion. IN CONTEXT

Castro must go
After World War II, Latin America 
became a proxy battleground for two competing ideological systems: capitalism and communism. The  
US was determined to eradicate communism and supported right-wing dictators with anti-reformist regimes in countries such as Cuba, Honduras, and Guatemala. 
During the 1950s, corruption  
and brutality within the Cuban Batista government forced a slow withdrawal of US support. When Castro defeated Batista in 1959,  the US government had misgivings over Castro’s communist leanings. By 1960, Castro had nationalized  all US interests in Cuba without compensation and had broken diplomatic ties. To protect their economic assets and defeat communism, US policy-makers decided that Castro must go. 
Within a year of Castro  
taking power, several counter-revolutionary groups were formed by Cuban exiles in Miami. The American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) took an interest  in these groups, providing them with training and equipment to topple the Cuban government. The failure at the Bay of Pigs was largely down to poor planning and President Kennedy’s reluctance to become too involved. 
Pro-Cuba demonstrations
Castro forged a closer alliance with the Soviet Union, its ally against American aggression, enabling him to export his ideals across Latin America. The invasion incited  pro-Cuba anti-US demonstrations from Chile to Mexico. Castro actively supported guerrilla warfare, and thousands of Latin American guerrillas went to Cuba for training. The revolution in Cuba inspired similar uprisings through the 1960s and 70s in Nicaragua, Brazil, Uruguay, and Venezuela, where there was disaffection with illiteracy, inequality, and poverty. 
Latin America continued to 
preoccupy US foreign policy. The US intervened several times in an effort to contain communism. They supported military coups in Chile in 1973 and Argentina in 1976 and, fearing a communist takeover, funded the El Salvadoran military in the late 1970s to prop up their regime. In 1983, the US invaded Grenada; and in 1989, Panama. 
■Fidel Castro
To his supporters, Fidel Castro 
(b.1926) was a revolutionary hero who stood up to the US. To his detractors, he was a dictator whose close ties with the Soviet Union brought the world close to nuclear war.
Jailed as a student in 1953 
for his revolutionary activities, Castro was released two years later and went into exile in the US and Mexico. He returned  
to Cuba in 1956 with a small guerrilla band, among them the Argentine Marxist revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara, and set to work undermining the regime of the dictator Batista. On January 1, 1959, he assumed absolute power. Castro was determined to improve literacy, offered free healthcare, and instituted land reforms. 
Castro saw himself as a 
leader of the world’s oppressed people and helped train anti-Apartheid forces in South Africa. In the 1970s, he sent troops to support communist forces in Angola, Ethiopia,  
and Yemen. 
In 2008, wracked by ill 
health, Castro stood down  
as president of Cuba, leaving power in the hands of his brother Raúl.

The Cultural Revolution was 
one of the darkest periods in Chinese history. Since

Party leader Mao Zedong had neither created his ideal China nor secured his power. To bolster his primacy and ignite revolutionary fervor, Mao decided to purge any opposition and transform capitalists and intellectuals into proletarians –  
ordinary workers . He ordered the 
Cultural Revolution, which would attack the “Four Olds”: old ideas, old habits, old customs, and old culture. Squads of young communists, incited by Mao and known as the Red Guards, terrorized intellectuals, IN CONTEXT

bureaucrats, and teachers. Some 
36 million people were persecuted, and up to a million died in the turmoil, which lasted until 1976. 
The Great Leap Forward
After creating the Chinese People’s Republic in 1949, Mao launched reforms to transform China’s semi-feudal, mostly agricultural society into an industrialized socialist state. In the late 1950s, in a bid to achieve rapid economic growth, Mao ordered the Great Leap Forward. Industrial output climbed with steel and coal production, the rail network doubled, and more than half of all Chinese land was irrigated by 1961. 
However, this development came 
at a terrible cost. Mao transformed rural China into a series of farming communes in which villagers pooled land, animals, tools, and crops. The authorities took vast amounts of grain from the communes to feed city workers, and this, along with  a series of natural disasters, led  to famine and starvation. The consequences were staggering: an estimated 45 million people died. 
A new foreign policy
After the Cultural Revolution, Mao needed American expertise to restore China, and the US wanted an ally against the Soviet Union. In 1972, US President Richard Nixon traveled to Peking to meet with Mao. By the time Mao died in 1976, China had become a major oil producer with nuclear capabilities. 
Deng Xiaoping, who led China 
from 1978 to 1997, was willing to use capitalist ideas to focus on economic growth. But while he initiated new and far-reaching measures, such as inviting foreign firms to invest in Chinese industry and supporting developing technologies, he  
also resisted pressure to make democratic reforms. 
By the beginning of the new 
millennium, China’s economic growth was spectacular. In 2001, the country was admitted to the World Trade Organization, and in 2008 it played host to the Olympic Games in Beijing. Some economists predict that by 2026 China will boast a gross domestic product (GDP) greater than Japan and Western Europe.
After Mao’s death, the Chinese 
Communist Party condemned  the Cultural Revolution as a disaster. However, as the country experienced a period of unparalleled economic growth, a sense of nostalgia for Mao’s ideals, focused on the people and self-sufficiency, grew among farmers and members of the urban working class. Today, Mao’s legacy continues to cast a long shadow over a modernizing China.

Mao Zedong Born in 1893 into a wealthy

While working as a librarian at Peking University, he became a communist and helped found the Communist Party in 1921. Six years later, after leading an unsuccessful rebellion against nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek, Mao was forced to retreat to the countryside, where he proclaimed the Chinese Soviet Republic in 1931. He took control of the Communist Party in 1935, after proving his leadership during the Long March, and defeated Chiang during the  
civil war of 1945–49. 
A devoted Leninist, Mao 
became disenchanted with  
the Soviet policy of “peaceful coexistence” toward the  West and developed Maoism,

of millions. One of his last acts, in 1972, was to hold a meeting with Richard Nixon, the first American president ever to

 THE SUEZ CRISIS (1956)
On July 26, 1956, Egyptian 
leader, Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser, addressed  
a crowd in the city of Alexandria, declaring the nationalization of the Suez Canal, the waterway through which most oil bound for Western Europe had to pass. For Egyptians, the nationalization symbolized the liberation of their country from the British imperialist dominance it  
had been under since the 1880s. In response to Nasser’s bold move, a secret plan was hatched by Britain, France, and Israel. France was eager for Nasser’s downfall because of  
his support for Algerian insurgents against French colonial rule in Algeria. Israel had many reasons for IN CONTEXT

good relations with Arab states, was appalled by the Anglo-French invasion, believing it threatened  
the stability of the whole region. President Dwight Eisenhower forced through a United Nations resolution imposing a ceasefire, and British and French troops had to conduct a humiliating withdrawal. 
Splitting the land
The strong anti-Western sentiment in the Middle East dates back hundreds of years, fueled by the West’s increased involvement in the region. Colonialism in the 1800s  and the division of the Ottoman Empire after World War I were bitter humiliations for peoples who felt their religion, Islam, was the highest form of divine revelation. In 1948, the partition of Palestine to form Israel spilt the land into two states, one Arab and one Jewish, and was rejected vehemently by Israeli Arabs and enraged the other Arab nations. The regular armies of the Arab states—including Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Transjordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Egypt—attacked Israel in the first Arab–Israeli War in May and June 1948. The war ended in defeat for the Arabs and disaster for the Palestinians: more than half of the country’s Arabs were uprooted as refugees, and they lost any possibility of a state of their own.

because of Nasser’s association 
with the Soviets and his unceasing diatribes against the West. Nasser felt insulted and immediately nationalized the Suez Canal. The move was popular in Egypt, as the canal was a source of Arab pride. 
Nasser was a secular modernizer 
who advocated the separation of religion from political life, believing it the hallmark of Arab modernity, but this was not universally welcomed. The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928, argued for Islam to have a central role in government. After repeated calls for the application of Sharia law—a legal system based on Islam—and an assassination attempt against Nasser, the organization was finally banned in 1954. 
In 1967, Arab countries suffered 
a crushing defeat at the hands  
of Israel in the Six Day War, in which Israel took the Sinai from Egypt, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, meaning Israel was now an occupier. In the 1970s and 80s, the Arab–Israeli conflict largely moved in the direction of peace: in 1979 the Israeli–Egypt peace deal ended 30 years of war. The rise of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLO) and of other Palestinian groups attacking Israel, however, as well  
as Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982, where many of the PLO were grouped, destabilized of the fragile peace continuously. 
The Iran–Iraq War
Like many countries in the Middle East, modern Iraq was carved out of the ruins of the Ottoman Empire in the aftermath of World War I. Iraq was a land divided along ethnic lines between Arabs and Kurds,  
as well as sectarian lines between Sunni and Shia Muslims, the latter being the majority group. Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, became leader in 1979, and suppressed ethnic Kurds and Shias alike using immense brutality. He, like Nasser in Egypt, espoused Arab nationalism and ruled Iraq as a secular state. 
In 1979, events in Iran inspired 
Islamists throughout the Middle East. The secular, Western way of life was swept away in an Islamic revolution in which the US-backed Shah was ousted. The new regime, under Ayatollah Khomeini, a Shia Muslim, based its laws and ideology on the strict teachings of the Koran. Saddam felt threatened by the Islamic revolution and a possible Shia uprising in his own country, so he invaded Iran on September  22, 1980 under the pretext of a territorial dispute over the Shatt al-Arab, a waterway that lies between the  
two countries. 
The invasion triggered a bruising 
eight-year war that devastated both countries and increased tensions  
in the Middle East. Iran’s principal ally was Syria, but Libya, China, and North Korea all also sent it weapons. Iraq’s support came mostly from  
the Arab Gulf states, which viewed Iran as the greater danger to their security; Saudi Arabia and Kuwait THE SUEZ CRISIS

provided billions of dollars in loans. 
Ultimately, Iran was defeated; and Iraq, now awash with armaments supplied by several Western nations, including Britain, France, and the United States, invaded the oil-rich state of Kuwait in 1990. The UN demanded their withdrawal, but Saddam announced that Kuwait had been annexed by Iraq. The United States, with support from coalition forces, sent in troops during the First Gulf War (1990–91) and toppled Saddam from power. 
The 9/11 attacks
The continued US support of Israel led to profound grievances among Islamists. To them, the capitalist, secular US, with its greed for oil, symbolized all that was wrong with the West, and terrorist strikes on US targets grew. Al-Qaeda carried out the most shocking on September 11, 2001, against four targets in the United States, including the World Trade Center in New York City. 
In response to the 9/11 attacks, 
a successful US-led international intervention brought down the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which the US believed had given sanctuary to Osama bin Laden and 
US_318-321_Suez_Crisis.indd   320 15/02/2016   16:45321
al-Qaeda. After September 11, President Bush declared a “War  on Terror” and, in 2002, with help from the British government, attacked Iraq on the premise of destroying “weapons of mass destruction” (WMDs) deemed a threat to national security. Western intervention in the Muslim world heightened the belief among Islamists that the West was the enemy of Islam.
The Arab Spring
The 9/11 attacks were inspired by  a radical ideology and belief that the fundamental problems plaguing Arab and Muslim people could  be resolved by attacking foreign powers that were seen to oppress Islam. In 2011, young Arabs—looking inward to promote change and blaming their own leaders for decades of political, economic, and cultural decline—were at the heart of uprisings across the Arab world. At its core, what became known  
as the Arab Spring was a new generation’s attempt to change the state order. An extraordinary series of pro-democracy uprisings, the Arab Spring caused huge upheavals in the Middle East and North Africa. It started in Tunisia on December 17, 2010 when a street vendor set himself on fire in a protest against police brutality. Protestors throughout Tunisia demanded democracy, and President Zine el Abidine fled the country on 14 January. Disorder spread from Tunisia to Algeria, where there  was unrest over lack of jobs.

Terrorism in the Middle East
Since the mid-20th century, 
terrorism has been synonymous with the Middle East. The Israel–Palestine conflict is one  
of the world’s most challenging. 
In 1964, Arab leaders  
formed the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), declaring Israel’s establishment illegal. The PLO used terrorism to attack Israel and Western targets for their support of Israel. In 1970, Palestinian militants blew up three hijacked planes in the Jordanian desert, and in 1972 a group linked to the PLO hit the Israeli Olympic team during the games in Munich, Germany. 
In 1983, Hezbollah, an Iran-  
backed fundamentalist Shiite Muslim group in Lebanon, blew up the Beirut barracks of both US Marine and French forces, killing 298 people. Hezbollah pioneered the use of suicide bombers in the Middle East. 
Both Jews and Muslims have 
employed terrorism to derail the many attempts that have been made at peace in the region.

al-Qaeda. After September 11, 
President Bush declared a “War  on Terror” and, in 2002, with help from the British government, attacked Iraq on the premise of destroying “weapons of mass destruction” (WMDs) deemed a threat to national security. Western intervention in the Muslim world heightened the belief among Islamists that the West was the enemy of Islam.
The Arab Spring
The 9/11 attacks were inspired by  a radical ideology and belief that the fundamental problems plaguing Arab and Muslim people could  be resolved by attacking foreign powers that were seen to oppress Islam. In 2011, young Arabs—looking inward to promote change and blaming their own leaders for decades of political, economic, and cultural decline—were at the heart of uprisings across the Arab world. At its core, what became known  
as the Arab Spring was a new generation’s attempt to change the state order. An extraordinary series of pro-democracy uprisings, the Arab Spring caused huge upheavals in the Middle East and North Africa. It started in Tunisia on December 17, 2010 when a street vendor set himself on fire in a protest against police brutality. Protestors throughout Tunisia demanded democracy, and President Zine el Abidine fled the country on 14 January. Disorder spread from Tunisia to Algeria, where there  was unrest over lack of jobs. 
On January 25, thousands of 
protestors took to the streets in Egypt, and after 18 days of protests there, President Hosni Mubarak resigned. By mid-February, civil unrest had swept through Bahrain, where it was brutally suppressed, and into Libya. Muammar Gaddafi’s violent response to the dissidents led to civil war.

 THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL ( 1989 )
For decades, the Berlin  
Wall, which separated  East and West Berlin,  
stood as a reminder of the Cold War, the bitter division between Soviet communism and Western capitalism. On November 9, 1989, the East German government lifted travel restrictions, and thousands  of people began converging at  the wall. East German border guards yielded in the face of ecstatic crowds. On November 10,  in extraordinary scenes, soldiers from both sides helped Berliners break through the wall. Over the next two days, more than 3 million people crossed the border. IN CONTEXT

Ruling the Eastern Bloc
At the end of World War II, the USSR 
had banned anti-communist parties in every Eastern European country, and created a bloc of satellite states under Soviet leadership, ruthlessly suppressing any opposition. In  
the fall of 1956, Hungary rose against its communist government, only to be crushed by Soviet tanks, and in 1968, the USSR invaded Czechoslovakia to remove a government it found too liberal. 
In the 1960s, Germany was still 
divided between East and West, and its former capital Berlin split into the Allied-operated West and the Soviet-controlled East. Each had its own German administration: democratic in the West, communist in the East. Thousands of East Germans escaped to the West,  and the country hemorrhaged  its skilled workers. On August 13, 1961, the government sealed off East from West Berlin with a fence, which, over time, became a heavily fortified barrier dividing the city, the nation, and family and friends. 
In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev  
was appointed as General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party. Aiming for warmer relations with the West, he set out new reforms: 
glasnost  (political “openness”)  
and perestroika  (liberal economic 
“restructuring”). Critically, he lifted the ban on Eastern Bloc countries reforming their political systems. 
Collapse of communism 
With the threat of Soviet military intervention removed, citizens in all Eastern Bloc countries protested to end communist rule. In June 1989, Poland’s Solidarity, originally a banned trade union, was elected to lead a coalition government. As the push for reform gathered pace, the East German government declared that its citizens would be able to visit West Berlin through any border crossing, including the Berlin Wall. 
The fall of the Berlin Wall was  
a momentous event. It marked an era that saw the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It allowed millions to travel more freely, and previously stifled economies across Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union opened up to the world. Many former communist countries were welcomed into NATO and joined the European Union. 
The world changed course in 
1989. Communism was dead in  
the East, and a reunified Germany was about to take its place at the heart of Europe.

In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev

radical reforms— glasnost  and 
perestroika —and in July 1989  
he announced that countries within the Warsaw Pact could hold openly contested elections. Poles, Czechs, Hungarians, and others opted for democratic governments, destabilizing the Soviet Union itself. 
In July 1991, the anti-
communist Boris Yeltsin was elected president of Russia. A month later, with Gorbachev weakened by an attempted coup by hardline communists, Yeltsin took advantage. He banned the Communist Party in Russia and met secretly with the leaders  
of Ukraine and Belarus, who agreed to secede from the  
Soviet Union. On Christmas  
Day 1991, Gorbachev resigned, leaving Yeltsin as president  
of the new Russian state. The former empire split into 15 new independent states, and the USSR was no more.

over poor campus facilities at Nanterre University in a suburb 
of Paris, France, spread across the country. In March, riot police were called to deal with the unrest, and hundreds of students descended on Nanterre. By May, the uprising had moved to the center of Paris, and the number of protestors swelled to thousands. Tension erupted on the streets, as demonstrators called for revolutionary social change and the collapse of the government. Within a few days, 8 million workers went on a wildcat strike that brought France to a standstill. 
A momentous year
France’s journey to near revolution is the defining event of 1968, a year of global protest. Much was against the Vietnam War, but many people also marched against oppressive regimes. Politics became more radical: the “coming out” of sexual minorities, women’s liberation, and sexual equality came to the fore. In the United States, groups such as the Black Panthers fought for racial equality; and the German Student Movement, led by Rudi Dutschke, opposed the older generation, who had been part of World War II. 
The French protests lost steam 
as elections showed overwhelming support for the government. The revolutionary movements of 1968 ultimately failed, but they inspired a generation to question authority. In their wake came a rise in left-wing terrorist groups that used bombing and kidnapping while purporting  to fight for social justice.

The fall of the Berlin Wall 322–23The Siege of Sarajevo, 
Bosnia, was one of the most appalling tragedies  
in Yugoslavia’s civil war (1991–2002). During the 44-month siege, the city’s food and electricity supplies were cut off, and the civilian population was bombarded by nationalist Bosnian Serbs. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims were targeted and murdered. 
A new wave of nationalism 
Yugoslavia was comprised of  
six socialist republics: Croatia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Serbia, each with its own prime minister and constitution. Overall power in Yugoslavia was held by a president, notably communist leader Josip Broz Tito from 1953 to 1980. 
After the 1991 break-up of the 
Soviet Union, a nationalist revival swept Eastern Europe. Croatia and Slovenia’s call for independence was opposed by Serbia, and Vukovar, in eastern Croatia, was destroyed by the Yugoslav army under Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic. When Bosnia also declared independence in 1992, the violence intensified. Bosnian Serbs aimed to create  a separate ethnically pure Serbian state, the Republika Srpska, carving it from the new Republic  
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Nationalist Bosnian Serbs, supported by neighboring Serbia, launched a campaign to expel non-Serbs, and during the Siege of Sarajevo, they targeted the majority Bosnian Muslim population. 
The Bosnian War ended in 1995, 
but fighting continued in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians began a separatist movement against the Serbs. Ethnically based nationalism also led to bloody anti-Armenian pogroms in the Nagorno-Karabakh region and in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. In Georgia, violence erupted between the Georgian and Abkhazian population. 
The wars in Yugoslavia forced 
the issue of the global community’s responsibility to resolve disputes that threaten wider instability  
or cause unacceptable human suffering or rights violations.

attack against the US. Two hijacked airliners crashed into the World Trade Center in New York; another hit the Pentagon, in Washington, DC; and a fourth plane crashed  in Pennsylvania. Almost 3,000 people were killed. 
The seeds of extremism
September 11 was not the first terror attack on American soil by Islamic extremists. On February 26, 1993, a bomb was detonated at the World Trade Center by men thought to have links to al-Qaeda, a militant Islamist organization. Some Muslims had been radicalized and adopted international terrorism during the struggles over Israel.  In 1979, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan led to the worldwide mobilization of Muslim militants to fight the invaders. Around that time, Osama Bin Laden formed al-Qaeda. Intelligence reports suggested that he was the mastermind behind September 11. He was killed in 2011. The civil war in Syria since 2011 and the power vacuum left by the departure of US forces in Iraq has led to the emergence of ISIS, the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, which has taken control of several towns in the region. 
The events of September 11 
mark the largest terrorist attack ever on US soil. Subsequent attacks in London, Madrid, and Paris, carried out by a diffuse network of regional terrorist groups, have added a chilling dimension to the threat of  
Islamic terrorism.

attack against the US. Two hijacked airliners crashed into the World Trade Center in New York; another hit the Pentagon, in Washington, DC; and a fourth plane crashed  in Pennsylvania. Almost 3,000 people were killed. 
The seeds of extremism
September 11 was not the first terror attack on American soil by Islamic extremists. On February 26, 1993, a bomb was detonated at the World Trade Center by men thought to have links to al-Qaeda, a militant Islamist organization. Some Muslims had been radicalized and adopted international terrorism during the struggles over Israel.  In 1979, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan led to the worldwide mobilization of Muslim militants to fight the invaders. Around that time, Osama Bin Laden formed al-Qaeda. Intelligence reports suggested that he was the mastermind behind September 11. He was killed in 2011. The civil war in Syria since 2011 and the power vacuum left by the departure of US forces in Iraq has led to the emergence of ISIS, the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, which has taken control of several towns in the region. 
The events of September 11 
mark the largest terrorist attack ever on US soil. Subsequent attacks in London, Madrid, and Paris, carried out by a diffuse network of regional terrorist groups, have added a chilling dimension to the threat of  
Islamic terrorism.

Berners-Lee was interested in facilitating the exchange of ideas between scientists in universities and research institutes, and he first proposed his idea for a worldwide network of computers sharing information in 1989.

The Internet 
The Soviet Union’s launch of the Sputnik 1 satellite in 1957 spurred the US Defense Department to consider means of communication after a nuclear attack. This led to the formation of the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) in 1969, a system initially of four computers. In the mid-1980s, this growing network of interconnected computers became known as the Internet. Both the Internet and the World Wide Web were limited to academic and research organizations. 
It wasn’t until the 1993 launch of 
a user-friendly Web browser called Mosaic that the Web took off for more general use. Mosaic could show pictures as well as text,  and users could follow Web links simply by clicking on them with  a mouse. The Web became synonymous with the Internet, but they are distinct from one another. The World Wide Web facilitated navigation of the Internet and helped make the Internet such an effective mode of communication. 
The computing revolution 
The introduction in 1981 of IBM’s 5150 personal computer drove a revolution in home and office computing. Smaller and cheaper than the large office computers, it and its successors had access to the Internet and email. With personal computers, the Internet saw huge growth. The first search engines began to appear in the early 1990s; Google, which is now almost synonymous with Web searches, arrived a little later, in 1997. The launch of online marketplace Amazon in 1994 revolutionized the way people shopped, allowing the purchase of everything from books and CDs to hotel rooms and airline tickets from the comfort of home. 
The Internet brought about 
significant changes to the way businesses operated; globalization escalated, and the world seemed  to become a much smaller place, with communication improved  by the speed and efficiency of the Internet. Jobs were outsourced,  and companies effectively became “nationless,” since it was easier to operate from anywhere in the world.

FINANCIAL SYSTEM  
 CLOSE TO COLLAPSE
 THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS ( 2008 )
The turn of the 21st century 
brought troubling signs  of a worldwide recession. 
Low interest rates and unregulated credit had induced more and more people to get into unsustainable debts. Bankers, particularly in the US, offered mortgages to customers with a poor credit history. These mortgages were called “subprime mortgages”. It was hoped that if people could not keep up with their mortgage payments, their houses could be repossessed and sold at a profit, but this depended on house prices rising. In 2007, interest rates crept up, and house prices fell. People began defaulting on their monthly repayments. Across the US, IN CONTEXT

packages to boost their economies. 
They increased government spending and decreased taxes. Others, especially in Europe,  
opted for austerity, freezing public spending, and increasing taxes. Protests and strikes swept through Europe in response to these measures. Portugal, Spain, and Greece came under pressure from the European Union (EU) to lower their debts. The EU spent billions propping up weak economies in an attempt to keep the Eurozone, and the euro, viable. But the effect of the economic crisis was devastating, and many people lost their homes and jobs. It was the worst economic downturn since World War II.
Post-war economy
After World War II, most of Europe, Japan, China, and the Soviet Union, all devastated by war, needed  
time to recover. The US, which  
had experienced a huge rise in manufacturing for the war effort and was spared destruction, continued manufacturing at  
higher levels than ever before and dominated the world economy.  
The post-war economic planners sought a new economic order  
based on industrial strength  and a stable dollar. In 1944, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was formed to foster the revival of global trade. The US’s strong post-war economy and the Marshall  Plan of 1947, a US-led initiative to aid Western countries, invigorated world trade through encouraging capitalism and the free exchange  of goods between nations. Signed in 1947, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) dictated that tariffs be removed to open up markets around the world.
The Asian tiger
Japan, meanwhile, saw massive economic growth. The Japanese government implemented reforms based on efficiency and restricted foreign imports. They did not  sign up to the GATT agreement until 1955. Japan invested in its coal and steel industries, as well as shipbuilding and car manufacturing. In the 1960s, Japan specialized in high-tech products such as cameras and computer chips. Countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia experienced similar growth with an emphasis on electronics and technology. These successes became collectively known as “Asian tiger economics.” THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS
The role of oil
By the 1970s, the world was divided between rich industrial countries and poor developing nations, and oil had become increasingly important. In 1960, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq, and Iran, was founded. As oil reserves in other countries dwindled, the states around the Persian Gulf, where this resource had remained plentiful, became dominant. In October 1973, when Egypt and Syria invaded Israel during the Yom Kippur War, OAPEC embargoed oil to any country helping Israel, and prices tripled. Without oil, industrial output dropped. The United States introduced strict fuel rationing, which ended in March 1974, when the oil embargo was lifted. 
A new economic model
The oil crisis in the mid-1970s led to a deep global recession, soaring inflation, and high unemployment. In response, a new “neo-liberal” economic policy was adopted, transferring control of economic factors from the public to the private sector. Welfare programs were perceived to be one cause of economic failures, and there were drastic cutbacks. Deregulation became the driving force behind world economics, sweeping away many governmental controls and freeing up organizations to trade across a wider range of territories. The need for this was particularly felt in the United States, which faced stiff competition from a  world now fully rebuilt from the The oil crisis that struck Western 
countries in 1973–74 was the result  of the Yom Kippur War. Fuel rationing in the US led to scenes such as this, with motorists getting stranded.

destruction of World War II. Some of 
the rigid laws and regulations that had been put in place to protect consumers were now considered to be interfering with free enterprise. 
The global push for deregulation 
resulted in the adoption of new markets, greater competition, and openness, especially as the world adapted to the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union. The example set in east Asia influenced policy makers in other Asian countries, such as India and China. Mexico and Brazil lowered their barriers to trade and embarked on economic reform, leading to a dramatic improvement in living standards. As East and West Germany reunited in 1989, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the European Union (EU), an economic union of 28 European countries, emerged as a major force in the world economy. Also in the 1980s, China opened  up to foreign trade, and huge sums of foreign investment poured in, leading to extraordinary growth. 
Global economy
The world economy is now far more open. Internet use allows people to order goods in one part of the world and have them delivered elsewhere within a matter of days. World trade is made up of global partnerships, with multinational companies that boast huge turnovers. Across the globe, people tend to migrate to cities to find work, resulting in  
an increase in urbanization. 
One complaint that is often 
aimed at globalization is that some companies exploit cheap labor and behave unethically in their bid for profit. Another is that globalization has contributed to the extraordinary accumulation of wealth by a few THE MODERN WORLD
individuals and, thus, increased inequality. Some countries have also remained extremely poor—areas of sub-Saharan Africa, for example have fared badly and been left behind, in debt to wealthier nations. 
Economic recessions have 
occurred throughout history, but the financial crisis of 2008–11 was the worst—at least since the Great Depression of 1929—and maybe  
the worst ever. Many felt it was  
an avoidable disaster caused by widespread failures in government regulation and heedless risk-taking by investment bankers. Only massive monetary and fiscal stimuli prevented catastrophe. Household and business debts remained high, and there was widespread fury directed at bankers, whom many felt had survived relatively unscathed. Austerity measures provoked civil unrest. Demonstrations were held against capitalism; the Occupy Movement spread, with tens of thousands marching in New York, London, Frankfurt, Madrid, Rome, Sydney, and Hong Kong. While financiers argued over the causes of the Global Recession, the impact  on the lives of ordinary people had profound, lasting consequences.

a movement set up in New York to protest against social and economic inequality. There were riots in Rome, strikes in Greece, demonstrations in Portugal,  
and occupations in the public squares of Barcelona, Moscow, Madrid, New York, Chicago,

On October 31, 2011, a baby 
girl born in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, 
was chosen by the United Nations (UN) to symbolically represent  
the 7 billionth person on earth.  
To mark this global-population milestone, October 31st was named Seven Billion Day, but with a billion people reported to be going hungry at that time, debates were rekindled about whether the Earth could support so many people. 
Before the 17th century, the 
world’s population increased very slowly, but it began to expand rapidly after 1850. This was in part due to a reduction in the number  
of children dying in infancy, but death rates fell overall, too, as new farming technology expanded the food supply and lowered the risk  
of famine. The marked increase  
of industrialization and advances  
in medicine improved public health and living standards.
By 1927, the world-population 
figure had reached 2 billion. In the early 20th century, population growth was highest in the rich industrialized West, but this pattern began to change. Mid-century saw many European countries experience falling birth rates, while population growth increased sharply in the relatively underdeveloped areas of Asia, Africa, and South America due to a much higher birth rate. In 1987, the 5 billionth person was born; and by 1999, the 6 billionth. It took 123 years for the world’s population to go from 1 billion to 2 billion but had taken only 12 years to make the leap from 6 billion to 7 billion. 
The Green Revolution
During the early 20th century,  
many countries imported large quantities of food that they were unable to grow themselves, to enable them to meet the demands of a growing population. Britain,  
for example, imported 55 million tons of food each year. 
In the early 1940s, Mexico 
imported half of its wheat, and its population was rapidly expanding. The country requested technical expertise from the United States on ways to increase wheat production. By 1944, with the financial support of the American Rockefeller Foundation, a group of US scientists, including American biochemist Norman Borlaug, had begun GLOBAL POPULATION EXCEEDS 7 BILLION

Population explosion 
BEFORE
1804  The world’s population 
reaches 1 billion. Population growth is the fastest in Europe.
1927  World population reaches 
2 billion as death rates fall and 
birth rates stay high.
1959  The approximately 
3 billionth baby is born. 1989  Annual World Population 
Day is established by the UN 
on July 11, inspired by the interest in the symbolic 5 billionth baby.
AFTER
2050  Global population is set 
to hit 9.7 billion, a slowdown in growth, with fewer babies born per household. 
2100  Estimates suggest that 
the world population will be 
over 11 billion, posing grave challenges for food supplies. 
Living longer
During the 20th century, life 
expectancy rose dramatically. In 2013, the average life expectancy worldwide, from birth, was 71.0 years. Health education, which focused on diet and basic hygiene, led to a reduction in infant mortality, and better sanitation and clean drinking water have reduced the risks of spreading infectious diseases, including cholera and typhoid. 
One of the biggest 
contributory factors to longer life expectancy has been the eradication of some killer diseases. The antibiotic drug penicillin, which helps fight bacterial infection, became widely used to treat diseases such as tuberculosis and syphilis. Later, mass vaccination programs by governments and the United Nations’ World Health Organization (WHO) helped eradicate smallpox and work toward the elimination of polio. Advances in medicine and diagnostics have revolutionized healthcare. Some scientists predict that by 2050, the average life expectancy will be 100.

researching methods of developing 
a high-yielding strain of wheat that could resist disease and was short in height, so as to reduce wind damage. The work in Mexico was incredibly successful: by 1956, the country was totally self-sufficient and no longer imported wheat and maize. This success launched  what became known as the Green Revolution—the spread of new modern agricultural technologies in the 1960s and 70s that dramatically increased food production around the world. The Green Revolution benefited countries that included the Philippines, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, China, Indonesia, Kenya, Iran, Thailand, and Turkey.
Indian scientists in particular 
had followed the work of Borlaug and his colleagues. In the mid-1960s, India had been struck by two back-to-back droughts, which led to the need for large food imports from the United States. In 1964, both India and Pakistan began importing and testing semi-dwarf varieties of wheat from Mexico, and the results were promising: in the spring of 1966, the harvest was larger than any ever produced in South Asia, despite it being a dry year. 
Miracle rice
In 1960, a new so-called miracle rice known as IR-8 was developed at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. With  its much reduced growing cycle,  this new product brought about a dramatic transformation in farmers’ lives. In countries such as Vietnam, two complete crops of the new  rice could now be produced each year, whereas the traditional rice  it replaced would only produce one crop. Stunning innovations such as this in agricultural science allowed chronically poor countries, in Asia in particular, to feed themselves and meet the demands of their growing populations. 
The Green Revolution did not 
come without controversy, not  least because it involved a move toward chemical pesticides. During the 1940s, the insecticide DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) was introduced as a way of controlling a variety of diseases, including mosquito-borne malaria, with a single treatment. However in 1962, American biologist Rachel Carson highlighted the dangers of DDT in her groundbreaking book Silent Spring , claiming that it may cause cancer and also be bad for the environment. Silent Spring  led 
to a nationwide ban on DDT in the US and raised enough concern  to trigger the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an independent body to safeguard the environment. The Green Revolution also faced huge challenges in many countries in Africa, where there was a lack of irrigation facilities, unreliable rainfall, high fertilizer prices, and no credit to buy new seed varieties.

Second Green Revolution, but this, 
too, proved controversial. GM crops are foods produced from organisms that have had changes added into their DNA via genetic engineering. They were introduced in America  
in 1994 when the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved  
the Flavr Savr tomato for sale. The delayed-ripening tomato had a longer shelf-life than conventional tomatoes, but trials using potatoes suggested that GM produce was toxic to rats. Most European Union (EU) governments banned the use of GM crops, while supporters of GM suggested that without genetic intervention, the world was destined to starve. Advocates of GM—notably the US, Brazil, Canada, Argentina, and Australia—believe it has the potential to combat disease and hunger. The feeling in Europe, Africa, and Asia is more cautious, with concern about pesticides and possible harm to health. 
Despite such opposition, GM 
technology is still being developed. It is thought that 670,000 children die from lack of vitamin A each year, a deficiency that causes diseases such as malaria and measles and leads to blindness. Advances in  the tackling of such deficiencies include, for example, the creation of “golden rice,” in which vitamin A  is added to ordinary rice. 
Disappearing farmland
While more—and stronger—crops were needed to feed an ever-growing global population, cities have swallowed up large tracts  of farmland and rural areas. At  GLOBAL POPULATION EXCEEDS 7 BILLION
the beginning of the 21st century, China experienced an onslaught  
of urban development that meant the loss of a large number of the country’s tiny farms. 
People have historically been 
drawn to cities for employment and social opportunities. In 1800, one  in four British people lived in cities, but by 1900 this had grown to three in four. Many moved from rural areas to the city, but people also moved from one country to another seeking refuge and a better life. The urban population in 2014 accounted for 54 percent of the total global population, up from 34 percent in 1960. In 2014, the  UN predicted that two-thirds of  the world will live in cities by  2050. However, lack of affordable accommodation is a key factor in homelessness: in sub-Saharan Africa, 70 percent of city-dwellers live in slums. Poor health and violent crime is an issue in the world’s major cities, as is the huge disparity between rich and poor. 
Climate change
Urbanization and development  have placed increasing stresses on the environment. As the world’s population grew, it became a  This is not a political issue. Or

standards without destroying the environment. Scientists believe that human activity is to blame  for climate change (or “global warming”). Since the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, global temperatures have continued to rise, with 2011–15 the warmest five-year period on record. 
Some of the reasons behind  
climate change are due to natural occurrences, but in the early 1970s the rise of environmentalism raised public doubts about the benefits  to the planet of human activity. Developing nations were being urged to reduce carbon emissions, which are thought to effect climate change. In 2015, India was opening a mine a month to lift its 1.3 billion citizens out of poverty rapidly. Developed countries, which had themselves contributed to climate change, caused a new tension by suggesting that developing nations should cease exploiting their own natural resources to improve the economic well-being of their people.Scientists warned that humans would pass the threshold beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible if greenhouse-gas emissions kept increasing. Sea levels are also  rising, eroding coastal areas and obliterating small islands in the South Pacific. Rainfall patterns are changing, leading to severe drought in Africa, and many species of animals are in danger of extinction. 
The threat of climate change is 
now considered so serious that leaders from around the world met in 2015 in Paris, France, at a conference to agree to reduce the build-up of greenhouse gases. In fraught negotiations, developing countries demanded that wealthier nations help pay for them to adapt to the effects of climate change, such as increased floods and droughts. In all, 196 nations adopted the first ever universal, legally binding, global climate deal, limiting global warming to the relatively safe level of 3.6°F (2°C). 
A hungry world
In the 1970s, ecology movements predicted that hundreds of millions would die from mass starvation by THE MODERN WORLD
the mid-1980s. This dire prediction did not come to pass, but with an astonishing 7 billion humans on the planet, there is an inevitable drain on natural resources. Overfishing, particularly in Indonesia and China, has led to fish stocks around the world falling rapidly, and the demand for water could soon outstrip supply. In 2015, the UN predicted that 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity by 2025. Coal, which drives industry and production, is in increasing demand but will eventually run out. 
The UN estimates that by 2050 
the global population will be at 9.7 billion, and that by 2100, 11.2 billion people will inhabit the Earth. Population dynamics are changing from high mortality and high fertility to low mortality and low fertility, with an increasingly elderly population worldwide, which will be difficult to support. Challenges such as climate change, migration and refugee crises, food and water insecurity, poverty, debt, and disease are greatly exacerbated by rapid population growth. Stabilizing the growth of the world’s population may be the key to global survival.

IRISH INDEPENDENCE
(1922)
In the 1918 general election, 
republicans seeking independence from the United Kingdom won a majority of Irish seats. After the republicans set up their own parliament (the Dáil) and declared Ireland independent, Britain sent troops to quell the rebellion. By 1922, however, the two sides reached an agreement that most of Ireland should become independent as the Irish Free State, while the six northeastern counties, which had a Protestant majority, should remain part of the United Kingdom. This division is still in place to this day.
THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR
(1936–39)
In 1930–31, republicans overthrew Spain’s military dictatorship and forced King Alfonso XIII into exile. The republican government introduced socialist reforms and reduced the power of the church and the military. However, a revolt by disgruntled army officers and members of the Fascist Falange party led to civil war in 1936.  The conflict escalated into an international ideological clash,  with Fascist Italy and Germany supporting the right-wing Nationalists, while socialists from all over Europe volunteered to join their Republican comrades in Spain. Nationalist leader General Francisco Franco led his side to victory and ruled as dictator of Spain until 1975.DE GAULLE FOUNDS THE 
FRENCH FIFTH REPUBLIC
(1958)
In 1958, France faced a crisis  
over the future of its colony  Algeria—members of the French army opposed that country’s independence and were in open revolt against the Fourth Republic’s policies. The Republic collapsed, and retired military and political leader General Charles de Gaulle proposed a new government system with a strong executive president. This proposal won approval in a referendum, and de Gaulle himself was elected president. This Fifth Republic is still in place in France.
SUHARTO REPLACES 
SUKARNO IN INDONESIA
(1965–67)
In 1965 there was an attempted 
coup against Indonesia’s President Sukarno, but troops under Major-General Suharto, who had led Indonesia to independence in 1940, defeated the rebels. Communists were blamed for the coup, and Suharto, having seized power from Sukarno, had some 500,000 alleged communists killed. As Indonesia’s second president, Suharto ruled until 1998, leading the country into a period of economic development, with better health and living conditions for many. However,  his government was corrupt— he embezzled millions of dollars—and his invasion of East Timor resulted in a massive death toll.FURTHER EVENTS
WORLD WAR II IN  
THE PACIFIC
(1941–45)
In December 1941, the Japanese bombed the US fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and launched a campaign of invasion in Thailand, Malaysia, Burma, the Philippines, and other targets. This action brought the US into World War II. US and Japanese forces were involved in years of bitter fighting, including a long air campaign; the largest ever naval battle at Leyte Gulf, Philippines (1944); a three-month land campaign to retake  the Philippines; the bloody 82-  
day battle of Okinawa; and the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945). 
THE FOUNDING OF THE 
UNITED NATIONS
(1944)
The United Nations was conceived 
during World War II as a way to bring the countries of the world together in order to prevent further devastating conflicts. Its aims were outlined at a 1944 conference at Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, DC, and it  
was formally established in 1945. Although the UN did not prevent subsequent wars, it has worked worldwide to promote peace and, through a range of special agencies and organizations, to champion education, health, human rights, independence for colonized peoples, and economic development. Most countries are now members.

THE MILITARY COUP  
IN BRAZIL
(1964)
The 1964 coup ousted Brazilian president João Goulart, whose social reforms were labeled “communist” by opponents. The coup, which was carried out by part of the army with US backing, ushered in a military government whose policies were  
in line with US views. There was a huge increase in foreign economic involvement in Brazil, and half of the country’s largest companies passed into foreign ownership. Brazil enjoyed high economic growth under the dictatorship, but at the expense of freedom, as opponents of the regime were treated harshly. 
THE RED ARMY FACTION’S 
TERRORIST ACTIVITY
(1970s)
In 1968, many western countries 
saw anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist demonstrations, strikes, and riots. These failed to produce any change, however, and in the aftermath, a number of groups evolved to pursue an armed anti-capitalist struggle. One of the most long-lasting of these groups was the Germany Red Army Faction, founded in 1970 and also known  as the Baader-Meinhof group, after two of its founders, Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof. The group carried out a series of terrorist attacks (including kidnappings, bombings, robberies, and murders), mostly in the 1970s but also in  later decades. Their activities—  
and those of similar groups such  as the Revolutionary Cells (also operating in Germany in the same period)—alienated most people.PINOCHET SEIZES POWER  
IN CHILE
(1973)
In 1973, a military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet deposed Chile’s elected socialist leader Salvador Allende, bringing Pinochet to power at the head of a military junta. The US opposed Allende’s left-wing government and backed the coup, because it considered its support for right-wing dictatorships in South America as part of its Cold War struggle against communism: socialist regimes were suppressed even if they were completely democratic. Pinochet, who was notorious for imprisoning, killing, and torturing his opponents, continued to receive American backing and ruled until 1990.
THE SOVIET INVASION  
OF AFGHANISTAN 
(1979)
In the late 1970s, Afghanistan’s  left-wing government (a close ally of the Soviet Union) was threatened by US-backed Muslim fighters, the mujahideen, who objected to the regime’s modernizing policies in areas such as women’s education. In 1979, the USSR invaded Afghanistan, beginning a 10-year war in which an estimated 1.5 million Afghans were killed and many others left the country. Groups of mujahideen guerrillas fought the invaders, who withdrew in 1989. The war left the USSR militarily and politically weakened, contributing to its collapse. A civil war then broke out between the mujahideen and the Afghan army, and power eventually passed to  the hardline Islamic Taliban.THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION
(1979)
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, headed a secular regime that westernized the country and brought prosperity for some. In the late 1970s, an increasingly strong opposition movement gained prominence, led by Islamic leaders such as Ayatollah Khomeini, who preached against the country’s encroaching secular capitalism (as well as against communism). In 1979, the Shah was forced to leave the country, and Ayatollah Khomeini installed a new government that was focused on very strict Muslim values. The revolution had a huge impact, particularly in highlighting the increasing prominence of Islam on the world stage and in relations between the countries of the west and the Middle East. 
THE US AND BRITAIN  
INVADE IRAQ
(2003)
The 2003 invasion of Iraq started a war that saw forces, mainly from the US and Britain, deposing  the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, who oppressed his own people, supported international terrorism, and, according to the US and its allies, possessed weapons of mass destruction. Although the latter claim proved to be unfounded,  the removal of Saddam Hussein was nonetheless welcomed by many Iraqis. However, the lack  of a post-war strategy brought further instability and violence to Iraq, and the war gave extremist opponents of the US and their allies a pretext for launching terrorist attacks against them.

The ultimate aim of history 
is human self-knowledge. In the words of 20th-century 
historian R. G. Collingwood: “The value of history is that it teaches  us what man has done and thus what man is.” We cannot hope to understand our lives without it.
History itself has a history. From 
earliest times, all societies—literate or pre-literate—told stories about their origins or their past, usually imaginative tales centering around the acts of gods and heroes. The first literate civilizations also kept records of the actions of their rulers, inscribed on clay tablets or on the walls of palaces and temples. But  at first these ancient societies made no attempt at a systematic inquiry into the truth of the past; they did not differentiate between what had really happened and the events manifest in myth and legend.
Ancient historical narrative
It was the Ancient Greek writers Herodotus and Thucydides in the 5th century 
bce who first explored 
questions about the past through the collection and interpretation of evidence—the word “history,” first used by Herodotus, means “inquiry” in Greek. Herodotus’s work still contained a considerable mixture of myth, but Thucydides’ account of the Peloponnesian War satisfies most criteria of modern historical study. It was based on interviews with eyewitnesses of the conflict and attributed events to human agency rather than the intervention and actions of the gods. 
Thucydides had invented one  
of the most durable forms of history: the detailed narrative of war and political conflict, diplomacy, and decision-making. The subsequent rise of Rome to dominance of the Mediterranean world encouraged historians to develop another genre of broader scope: the account of “how we got to where we are today.” The Hellenic historian Polybius  
(200–118 
bce) and the Roman 
historian Livy (59 bce–17 ce) both sought to create a narrative of the rise of Rome—a “big picture” that would help to make sense of events on a large timescale. Although restricted to the Roman world, this was the beginning of what is sometimes called “universal history,” which attempts to describe progress from earliest origins to the present as a story with a goal, giving the past apparent purpose and direction. 
At the same period in China, 
historian Sima Qian (c.145–86 
bce) 
was similarly tracing Chinese history over thousands of years, from the legendary Yellow Emperor (c.2697 
bce) to the Han dynasty 
under Emperor Wu (c.109 bce).
Moral lessons
As well as making sense of events through narratives, historians in the ancient world established the tradition of history as a source of moral lessons and reflections. The history writing of Livy or Tacitus (56–117 
ce), for instance, was in part 
designed to examine the behavior of heroes and villains, meditating  
on the strengths and weaknesses in the characters of emperors and generals, providing exemplars for the virtuous to imitate or shun. This continues to be one of the functions of history. French chronicler Jean Froissart (1337–1405) said he had INTRODUCTION

written his accounts of chivalrous knights fighting in the Hundred Years’ War “so that brave men should be inspired thereby to follow such examples.” Today, historical studies of Lincoln, Churchill, Gandhi, or Martin Luther King, Jr. perform the same function. 
The “Dark Ages”
The rise of Christianity in the late Roman Empire fundamentally changed the concept of history in Europe. Historical events came to be viewed by Christians as divine providence, or the working out of God’s will. Skeptical inquiry into what actually happened was usually neglected, and accounts of miracles and martyrdoms were generally accepted as true without question. The Muslim world, in this as in other ways, was frequently more sophisticated than Christendom  in Medieval times, with the Arab historian Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) railing against the blind, uncritical acceptance of fanciful accounts of events that could not be verified. 
Neither Christian nor Muslim 
historians produced a work on the scale of the chronicle of Chinese history published under the Song dynasty in 1085, which recorded Chinese history spanning almost 1,400 years and filled 294 volumes. Renaissance Humanism
Whatever the undoubted merits  of other civilizations’ traditions of history writing, it was in Western Europe that modern historiography evolved. The Renaissance—which began in Italy in the 15th century, then spread throughout Europe  lasting until the end of the 16th century in some areas—centered upon the rediscovery of the past. Renaissance thinkers found a fertile source of inspiration in classical antiquity, in areas as diverse as architecture, philosophy, politics, and military tactics. The humanist scholars of the Renaissance period declared history one of the principal subjects in their new educational curriculum, and the antiquary became a familiar figure in elite circles, rummaging among ancient ruins and building up collections  of old coins and inscriptions. At the same time, the spread of printing made history available to a much wider audience than ever before.
The Enlightenment
By the 18th century in Europe, the methodology of history—which consisted of ascertaining facts by criticizing and comparing historical sources—had reached a fair level of sophistication. European thinkers had reached general agreement on the division of the past into three main periods: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern. This periodization was at root a value judgment, with the Medieval period, dominated  by the Church, viewed as a time  of irrationality and barbarism and separating the dignified world of the ancient civilizations from the newly emerging, rational universe of modern Europe. Enlightenment philosophers wrote histories that ridiculed the follies of the past. 
The Romantic spirit
In stark contrast, the Romantic movement that swept across Europe from the late 18th century found  an intrinsic value in the difference between the past and the present.

The Romantics drew inspiration from 
the Middle Ages, and instead of seeing the past as a preparation for the modern world, as had previously been the case, Romantic historians tried the imaginative exercise of entering into the spirit of past ages. Much of this was associated with nationalism. The German Romantic thinker Johann Gottfried Herder (1774–1803) burrowed into the past in search of roots of national identity and an authentic “German spirit.” As nationalism triumphed in Europe in the 19th century, much of history became a celebration of national characteristics and national heroes, often veering into myth-making. Every country wanted to have its sacred heroic history, just as it had its flag and its national anthem.  
The “Grand Narrative” 
In the 19th century, history became increasingly important and took on the quality of destiny. Arrogantly, European civilization saw itself as the goal to which all history had been progressing and constructed narratives that made sense of the past in those terms. The German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) articulated a grand scheme of history as a logical development, which culminated in the end point of the Prussian state. Philosopher and social revolutionary Karl Marx (1818–83) later adapted Hegel’s scheme into his own theory (“historical materialism”), in which he claimed that economic progress, which caused conflict between the social classes, would inevitably one day result in the proletariat seizing power from the bourgeoisie, while the capitalist world order collapsed under its own inner contradictions. Arguably, Marxism was to prove the most influential and durable  of all historical “grand narratives.” 
Like other areas of knowledge, 
in the 19th century history under-went professionalization and it became an academic discipline. Academic history aspired to  the status of a science, and the accumulation of “facts” was its avowed purpose. A gap opened up between “serious” history—often heavy on economic statistics—  
and the colorful literary works of popular historians, such as Jules Michelet (1798–1874) and Thomas Macaulay (1800–59).

In the 20th century, the subject matter of history—which had always focused on kings, queens, prime ministers, presidents, and generals—increasingly expanded  to embrace the common people, whose role in historical events became accessible through more in-depth research. Some historians (initially those in France) chose to disregard the “history of events” altogether, preferring instead to study social structures and the patterns of everyday life, beliefs, and ways of thinking (“mentalités”) of ordinary people in different historical periods. 
A Eurocentric approach
Broadly speaking, until the second half of the 20th century, most world history was written as the story of the triumph of Western civilization. This approach was as implicit in Marxist versions of history as in those histories that celebrated the INTRODUCTION

It aims to present a general reader with an overview of world history through specific moments, or events, which can act as windows upon selected areas of the past. In line with contemporary concerns, this book also reflects the long-term importance of key factors such as population growth, climate, and  the environment throughout human history.

of humans and “pre-history” and then progresses through different historical ages to the present day. In reality of course there were no such clear breaks between epochs, and where there is an overlap on dates, entries are included in the most appropriate ideological era. 
As this book illustrates, history 
is a process rather than a series of unconnected events. We can only speculate on how the events we experience today will shape the history of tomorrow. No one in the early 21st century can possibly claim to make sense of history, but it remains the fundamental discipline for anyone who believes, as the poet Alexander Pope did, that “the proper study of Mankind is Man.”

It is widely believed that the 
origins of the human race lie in Africa. By the usual processes 
of biological evolution and natural selection, the genus Homo  evolved 
in East Africa over millions of years alongside the chimpanzees, its near relatives. By the same biological processes, Homo sapiens— modern 
humans—evolved alongside other hominins (the relatives of humans, including Neanderthals, who died out 40,000 years ago).
About 100,000 years ago or so, 
the scattered bands of hunting and foraging humans would have been almost indistinguishable from the other great apes. But at some point (precisely when is hard to define) humans began to change in a new way, not by the process of biological evolution but by cultural evolution. They developed the ability to alter their way of life through the creation of tools, languages, beliefs, social customs, and art. By the time they were painting exquisite pictures of animals on the walls of caves and carving or sculpting figurines out  of stone or bone, they had marked themselves out uniquely from other animals. Their transformation was slow in the early years, but it was set to gather incredible momentum over millennia. Humans had become the only animals with a history.
Discovering history 
The early development of human cultures and societies presents a particular problem to historians. The first writing was not invented until quite late in the human story—  
about 5,000 years ago. Traditionally, the period before writing tended to be dismissed as “pre-history,” since it left no documents for historians to study. However, in recent years  a wide range of new scientific methods—including the study of genetic material and radiocarbon dating of organic remains—have been added to the long-established techniques of archaeology, enabling scholars to shine at least a flickering light upon the pre-literate era. 
The narrative of the distant 
human past is under constant revision as new discoveries and research—its findings frequently disputed—create radical shifts in perspective. The fresh investigation of a single cave, a burial site, or a human skull can still throw large areas of accepted knowledge into question. However, in the 21st century much of the history of early humans can be described with a reasonable degree of confidence.INTRODUCTION

Nomadic hunter-gatherers
All historians agree that until about 12,000 years ago humans were hunter-gatherers, using stone tools and living in small, mobile groups. This period is referred to as the Paleolithic Era (or Old Stone Age). Humans were a successful species, expanding their numbers to perhaps 10 million and spreading to most parts of the Earth. Generally, they adapted well to the major natural climate changes that occurred over tens of thousands of years, although they were temporarily driven out of northerly areas, such as Britain and Scandinavia, during the coldest phase of what is popularly known as the Ice Age. 
Humans existed in an intimate 
relationship with their natural environment, but their effect on that environment even at this early stage was not necessarily benign. There is a disturbing coincidence between the spread of human hunters across the planet and the extinction of megafauna such as woolly mammoths and mastodons. Although human hunting is far from being identified as the sole cause of these extinctions—natural climate change may well have been a contributing factor—from our modern perspective they can seem to set a troubling precedent.
The farming revolution
The hunter-gatherer lifestyle, which can reasonably be described as “natural” to human beings, appears to have had much to recommend  it. Examination of human remains from early hunter-gatherer societies has suggested that our ancestors usually enjoyed abundant food, obtainable without excessive effort, and suffered very few diseases.  If this is true, it is not clear what then motivated so many human beings all over the world to settle  
in permanent villages and develop agriculture, growing crops and domesticating animals: cultivating fields was grindingly hard work, and it was in farming villages that epidemic diseases first took root. 
Whatever its immediate effect 
on the quality of life for humans, the development of settlements and agriculture indisputably led to a high increase in population density. Sometimes known as the Neolithic Revolution (or New Stone Age), this period was a major turning point in human development, opening the way to the growth of the first towns and cities, and eventually leading to settled “civilizations.”

years ago, although the earliest 
dates are controversial. Small groups may have visited much earlier, but the bulk of the evidence suggests widespread colonization of Australia only around 45,000 years ago, at much the same time as Homo sapiens  arrived in Europe.
Other hominin species
Homo sapiens  was the first hominin 
to arrive in Australia. However, in parts of Eurasia, humans did face competition. By the time humans reached Europe, Neanderthals  had already been there for around 250,000 years, having evolved  from an ancestor they shared  with modern humans, Homo heidelbergensis , and they were  
well adapted to life in the region. 
Further east, at Denisova Cave 
in Russia’s Altai Mountains, there is evidence of a mysterious species—the Denisovans—known only from their DNA. And on the island of Flores in Southeast Asia, fossils of another possible species—the short, small-brained Homo floresiensis —
date from just 18,000 years ago, although some researchers believe these were simply modern humans afflicted with some form of disease. 
Of all these species, Homo 
sapiens  is the only one to have 
survived and gone on to colonize the New World. Beringia, a land-bridge between Russia and Alaska, exposed when sea levels dropped as a result of the Ice Age, allowed humans to reach the Americas  from northeast Asia. The exact date remains controversial: stone tools from the c.13,000-year-old “Clovis culture” were once thought to have belonged to the earliest humans  in the New World. Older sites are now known, but many of the earlier dates, particularly in South America, remain highly contentious. 
The social network 
Until more evidence is found, the fates of the Denisovans and Homo floresiensis  remain unknown, while 
the most recent research suggests Neanderthals died out around 40,000 years ago. Many researchers believe the resourcefulness of Homo sapiens  
was crucial to its success in other species’ home territories in the face of climate change around the time of the Last Glacial Maximum. In particular, it is thought that they could also rely on more extensive social networks than those other species—an asset that would have proved crucial both to survival in lean times and to helping them colonize the unfamiliar environments they encountered as they expanded across the globe, perhaps following animal herds. 
■Homo sapiens : the only remaining hominin
There is no evidence of violence 
between humans and other species. Indeed, modern human DNA shows small traces of Neanderthal and Denisovan genes, suggesting that a few individuals from each species interbred, albeit rarely. 
Although Neanderthals were 
skilled manufacturers of stone tools and excellent hunters, modern humans may have been quicker to adapt, and therefore better able to cope with the rapid climatic changes occurring as the Ice Age progressed.  They developed new stone tools, as well as techniques  that made use of resources such as bone and antler. They also established extensive networks of support, enabling various groups to pool resources across large distances, enhancing  their chances of survival. This cultural adaptability may have been what allowed humans  to outcompete their cousins  for access to increasingly unpredictable resources. The human blitzkrieg across 
America testifies to the 
incomparable ingenuity and 
the unsurpassed adaptability 
of Homo sapiens .

The Altamira cave complex, 
near Santander on the northern coast of Spain, 
comprises a series of passages  and chambers extending for nearly 984ft (300m) that boast some of  the best examples of Stone Age, or Paleolithic, cave art yet discovered. So impressive are the paintings that when the cave was discovered in 1880, they were widely considered fakes and took nearly 20 years to be accepted as the genuine creations of prehistoric hunter-gatherers. Some of the early artistic activity here may date from more than 35,000 years ago, although most of the famous paintings were probably created much later, around 22,000 years ago. These include the images in the famous Bison Chamber:  here the low ceiling is covered in representations of animals including multicolored, lifelike images of bison, expertly painted across the natural undulations of the rock in such a way as to make them appear almost three-dimensional.
The artistic impetus 
Other stunning displays of cave  art are also known, concentrated  in southwest France and northern Spain. They include not only  finely detailed images of animals, but also engraved and painted signs, symbols, and handprints. Archaeologists remain divided over the meaning and function of Stone Age art. One explanation is simply that these people appreciated the aesthetic qualities of art—just as their descendants do today. Others suggest that the incredible detail of some of the images—the sex of the animal or the season in which it was observed can still be determined, for example—may mean the paintings were a means of conveying vital survival information, such as which animals to hunt, and when and how they could be found and targeted. 
Hunting rituals
Alternatively, cave art might  be linked to the world views or religions of Paleolithic people.  Even today, many societies still living mainly by hunting and gathering share animistic beliefs, meaning they believe entities such as animals, plants, and parts of the landscape have spirits with which humans interact during their daily life. Many such societies’ religious specialists, or shamans, believe CAVE PAINTINGS AT ALTAMIRA

Creating images of animals  
may have also been part of “magic” rituals designed to improve the chances of success during hunting. For societies dependent on animal resources for a significant part of their diet, the importance of such rituals cannot be overstated. 
Initiation ceremonies
Other researchers have noted  that many of the handprints and footprints found beside the  art in the caves seem to belong  to quite young individuals. Traveling down into dark, damp, and potentially dangerous caves with only a lamp filled with animal fat might have been a form of initiation test for young people—one that would have required a great deal of courage to endure. 
Burials and the afterlife
More evidence of human beings engaging in religious or ritual practices at this time comes  from burials. At the site of Dolní Ve ˇstonice, in the Czech Republic, for example, three bodies were buried together in a sexually suggestive pose, with one of the male individuals flanking a female skeleton reaching toward her pelvis, and the male on the other side buried face down.

share the same rare skeletal 
deformities and may therefore have been related. Although the reasons why these bodies were arranged this way will probably always be a mystery, it is clear that there was more to this burial than just the functional disposal of remains. 
At other sites, some individuals 
were buried with many “grave goods”—for example, the complex jewelry made from dentalium shells at Arene Candide, in Italy, and the striking spears fashioned from mammoth ivory at the burial site  
of two young children in Sunghir,  
in Russia. Some researchers have suggested that these richly adorned individuals—especially the young ones, who would not have had  
time in their short life to establish  
a reputation that might account  
for special treatment in death—imply that hierarchies and status distinctions were beginning to develop in some groups. However, they do not appear to have become widespread until much later. It is clear, however, that for the first  time, people were now increasingly concerned with what happened after death, and about how the dead should enter into the afterlife. 
Marking territory
Other researchers note that most “classic” Paleolithic cave art is concentrated in southwest France and northern Spain. This region would have been a relatively favorable place to live: even at the height of the Last Glacial Maximum, more southerly, warmer climates and hence more productive habitats attracted dense herds of animals. As a result, people may have lived here in fairly large numbers, packed closely together, leading to greater social tensions among groups vying for territory and resources. 
Just as human groups today— 
whether it be football supporters  or nation states—use symbols such as flags, costumes, and markings of CAVE PAINTINGS AT ALTAMIRA
borders, territories, and group identities, so European Paleolithic groups may have decorated caves for similar reasons at a time when there was the potential for intense competition for resources. 
Cooperation to survive
Such complex social interactions may help explain how Homo sapiens  
was able to survive in the harsh environments of Ice Age Europe. Hunter-gatherers probably lived in small groups scattered at relatively low densities across the landscape. Most archaeological sites from  
this time do not demonstrate any evidence of complex buildings or structures, suggesting that people moved around a lot, according  
to the weather and the local environment, often following large herds of animals like reindeer as they migrated with the seasons. 
Homo sapiens ’ ability to forge 
new relationships readily allowed groups of hunters to combine as and when necessary. When resources were plentiful, they would hunt together—for example, intercepting migrating herds of reindeer at places in the landscape where they were most vulnerable, such as in People thought of themselves 
as part of a living world, where 
animals, plants, and even 
landmarks and inanimate 
objects had lives of their own.

Historians are still unsure whether or not there are precise 
meanings behind the majority of cave art. Their best guesses are that they may relate to any one or more of several possibilities: art for art’s sake; spirituality; initiation rites; the marking of territory; and a method of imparting valuable information about hunting.

In leaner times, these groups would split up again and range far across the landscape to find enough wild resources to sustain themselves. 
Early technologies
These hunter-gatherers expended considerable effort on hunting technology, since it could spell  the difference between life and death. They hafted elaborately worked stone tips on to spears that were then launched at the target using atlatls, or spear-throwers, designed to increase the distance over which a spear could travel  and the force with which it hit its target. These tools were crucial to hunting success, so it is no surprise that some of these atlatls were beautifully carved and decorated, often with representations of the animals being hunted. Similarly, they also painstakingly carved complex barbed harpoons from bone and antler for fishing.

animal skin and fur with much more care than their predecessors, and they made many other items—from jewelry finely crafted from animal teeth and shell, to figurines carved from stone or sculpted from clay. Many of these may also have been traded, gifted, or exchanged with individuals from other groups as part of large-scale social networks. 
The unpredictable environments 
of Europe during the Last Glacial Maximum meant sharing resources with other groups in times of plenty could pay off significantly at a  
later date: if a group struggled to find resources in one area, others elsewhere who had previously benefited from their generosity would be more inclined to return the favor. These kinds of exchange relationships probably linked even very far-flung groups together into complex networks of individual  
and group relationships that were fundamental to survival in such  
a tough environment.

However, toward  the end of the Ice Age, these shifts became more pronounced and occurred at shorter intervals, culminating around 21000

a “Big Freeze,” a period of intense cold known as the Last Glacial Maximum. People and animals living in northern regions died  out or retreated south as ice caps expanded to reach southern IN CONTEXT

water froze that sea levels dropped, exposing low-lying land such as Beringia, the continental shelf that connects North America and Asia—and the route by which humans first reached the Americas. 
Rising temperatures
Temperatures eventually rose again, and today’s relatively warm and stable climate had become established by around 7000 
bce. 
The ice caps melted, and rising sea levels separated Eurasia from the Americas, turned Southeast Asia into an archipelago, and made islands out of peninsulas such as Japan and Britain, thereby isolating many human groups. The impact on ecosystems was particularly severe for the large animals known as megafauna—mammoths, for example. The open glacial steppe grasslands in which megafauna thrived were replaced by expanding forests, and across the globe the combination of environmental change and human hunting drove many species to extinction. The forests and wetlands of the new post-glacial world offered humans many new opportunities. They hunted large forest animals such as red deer and wild boar,  as well as smaller mammals like rabbits, and they foraged for a range of aquatic and coastal food sources. Migratory fish like salmon, sea mammals such as seals, and shellfish, seasonal wildfowl, and  a range of fruits, tubers, nuts,  and seeds all became important dietary staples. 
Changing lifestyles
In areas that were particularly  rich in natural resources, human groups may not have settled in  one place, sending small bands  on forays further afield to target specific resources. The Natufian communities of the Eastern Mediterranean, for example, were able to exploit abundant stands  of wild cereals in the Near East. Some groups began to manipulate their environments, burning vegetation and cutting down  trees to encourage their preferred plant and animal species to thrive. They started to select and care for productive plant species and sowed the seeds of favored strains, while managing and controlling certain animals. This manipulation led to these species becoming ever more reliant on human input—and to  the development of agriculture, a radical change in the human way  of life that has since resulted in even more dramatic human impact on the environment.

Ice cores and past environments
Paleoclimatologists study the 
elemental composition of the sediments laid down over time on ocean floors to understand how climates have changed in the past. Tiny sea creatures known as foraminifera absorb two different forms of oxygen, 
16O and 18O, from sea water. 
Because 16O is the lighter of the 
two, it evaporates into the air more easily, but during warmer periods it falls as rain and drains back to the sea. So 
16O and 18O 
exist in sea water and appear  in the shells of foraminifera, in roughly equal ratios. However, in cold conditions most of the evaporated 
16O does not return 
to the ocean but freezes as ice, so sea water contains more 
18O 
than 16O. When foraminifera die, 
their shells sink to the ocean floor, building up over time. Paleoclimatologists drill into  
the ocean floor to extract cores of sediment and study the changing proportions of 
16O and 
18O in different layers to see how 
climates have changed over time.Few humans have ever  
lived in a world of such 
extreme climatic and 
environmental change.

in the world due to its size, density of settlement, spectacular wall paintings, and evidence of complex religious and ritual behavior.  Since its discovery, several other large settlements across West Asia have been found that attest

Early villagers invested time and 
effort in planting and cultivating crops, then in storing the harvest  to last the year, so they could no longer simply move as foragers had. 
Community cohesion
It is thought that the development of more formal religious organization and group ritual practices may have helped community cohesion. At many sites, buildings were set aside for such purposes; these were larger than domestic structures, with unusual features such as lime plaster benches and more evidence of symbolic and representational art: Çatalhöyük boasts murals and figurines of a range of subjects including wild animals such as bulls, leopards, and vultures. At many sites, some inhabitants remained in the community even when they died; they were buried under the floors of the houses. Sometimes they were later dug up and their skulls removed; facial features were molded on some in plaster and painted with ochre for display. At sites like Ain Ghazal in Jordan, large statues made of lime plaster have been found, and there are many examples of clay figurines of animals and (mainly female) humans. It is not clear whether these decorated skulls, statues,  
and figurines represent specific individuals or heads of households or lineages, or perhaps mythical ancestors or gods, but they may have been part of the communal ideologies, rituals, and social practices that helped smooth over tensions between individuals and broader regional groups, who were establishing more formal links with one another for long-distance trade and exchange of goods. Some of  
the success of Çatalhöyük may have been due to its role as a center for the large-scale trade of items made from the obsidian, or volcanic glass, of Hasan Dag ˇ. 
The many dramatic social and 
economic changes that came with the Neolithic revolution have helped shape both human history and the world’s ecosystems ever since. 
■
Farming and health
The adoption of farming 
established a plentiful and stable long-term source of food, allowing for population growth. However, there were negative consequences, too. Farmers  
may have had to work harder  
at times than hunter-gatherers did, and their more limited  
diets—focused on just a few crops and animal species—led  
to nutritional deficiencies. 
The health of early farmers 
also suffered in other ways. Living at close quarters with animals meant that some animal diseases spread to humans—for example, smallpox, anthrax, tuberculosis, and the flu. Larger communities living at higher densities allowed for such diseases to be more easily passed around. It also caused problems in disposing of human and animal waste and thus a  
rise in intestinal complaints  
and waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid, while irrigation created breeding grounds for mosquitoes and parasites, infecting humans with diseases like malaria.

the success of Çatalhöyük may have been due to its role as a center for the large-scale trade of items made from the obsidian, or volcanic glass, of Hasan Dag ˇ. 
The many dramatic social and 
economic changes that came with the Neolithic revolution have helped shape both human history and the world’s ecosystems ever since.

Farming and health
The adoption of farming 
established a plentiful and stable long-term source of food, allowing for population growth. However, there were negative consequences, too. Farmers  
may have had to work harder  
at times than hunter-gatherers did, and their more limited  
diets—focused on just a few crops and animal species—led  
to nutritional deficiencies. 
The health of early farmers 
also suffered in other ways. Living at close quarters with animals meant that some animal diseases spread to humans—for example, smallpox, anthrax, tuberculosis, and the flu. Larger communities living at higher densities allowed for such diseases to be more easily passed around. It also caused problems in disposing of human and animal waste and thus a  
rise in intestinal complaints  
and waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid, while irrigation created breeding grounds for mosquitoes and parasites, infecting humans with diseases like malaria.

About 5,000 years ago, 
humans began to form societies of unprecedented 
complexity. These “civilizations” typically had state structures and social hierarchies, they built cities and monuments such as temples, palaces, and pyramids, and used some form of writing. The basis for the development of civilizations was progress in agriculture. When only part of the population was required to work in the fields to produce food, the rest could inhabit towns and palaces, performing a range of specialty functions as bureaucrats, traders, scribes, and priests. The invention of civilization undoubtedly raised human life to a new level in many ways—in technology, the arts, astronomy, the measurement of time, literature, and philosophy— but also established inequality and exploitation as the basis of society, leading to larger-scale warfare as states expanded into empires.
Emerging civilizations
The earliest civilizations developed  
in areas where it was possible  to practice intensive agriculture, usually involving use of irrigation systems—for instance, along the rivers of the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), the Nile in Egypt, the Indus in northern India and Pakistan, and the Yangtze and Yellow rivers in China. Although these civilizations of Eurasia and North Africa seem to have been founded independently of one another, they developed multiple contacts over time, sharing ideas, technology, and even diseases. All followed a pattern in which stone tools (the Stone Age) were replaced by bronze (the Bronze Age) and then predominantly iron (the Iron Age). In the Americas, where the Olmec and Maya developed the civilizations of Mesoamerica, the use of stone tools persisted and most of the epidemic diseases that plagued Eurasia were unknown. 
Writing and philosophy
From around 1000 bce, Eurasian 
civilizations found an innovative momentum. The use of writing evolved from practical record-keeping to the creation of sacred books and classic literary texts that embodied the founding myths and beliefs of different societies, from the Homeric tales in Greece to the Five Classics of Confucianism  in China and the Hindu Vedas in India. Forms of writing using an alphabet developed in the eastern INTRODUCTION

Growing populations  
The ancient world reached the peak of its classical period around 2,000 years ago. The world’s population had grown from around 20 million at the time of the first civilizations to an estimated 200 million. About 50 million of these lived in a united Han China, while about the same number were under the governance of the Roman Empire, which had extended its rule to the shores of the Atlantic and the borders of Persia. In large part, the empires were successful because of efficient communications by land and water, and the ruthless deployment of military power. Long-distance trade routes linked Europe to India and China, and cities had expanded to  
a great degree—Rome’s population was estimated at over 1 million.

The causes of the decline of these powerful classical empires from  the 3rd century

Internal power struggles were also a major factor, leading to political fragmentation and a decline in the quality of government. But perhaps most crucial was the geographical limitation of the civilized areas of Eurasia. Both the Roman and Han empires built walls to mark and defend the borders of their empires, beyond which lived mostly nomadic or semi-nomadic “barbarian” tribes. The civilized societies had little or no military advantage over these peoples, who increasingly raided or settled within their territories. The eastern part of the Christianized Roman Empire survived until 1453, and Chinese civilization revived to full vigor under the Tang dynasty from 618, but Western Europe would take centuries to recover the levels of population and organization that it had known under the rule  of Rome.

Sometimes called the Bronze Age Revolution, this great step forward can be seen as the most important change in the human world before the Industrial Revolution. Mesopotamian unification
For much of the 4th to the 2nd millennia 
bce, Mesopotamia was  
a mosaic of competing kingdoms and city-states such as Uruk, Isin, Lagash, Ur, Nippur, and Larsa. Hammurabi, the Amorite king of Babylon, unified the region through a combination of guile, diplomacy, opportunism, military might, and longevity. As was traditional with conquering kings, Hammurabi  used previous edicts as the basis  for his laws, but these laws were distinguished by the reach of his empire, and by the fact that they were inscribed on stelae (stone slabs), and so recorded in perpetuity. 
Hammurabi’s laws and their 
detailed prelude reveal much about life in what is known as the Old Babylonian Period. They contain judgments on matters ranging from property disputes and violence against the person, to runaway slaves and witchcraft.
Hammurabi’s legacy
Although Hammurabi’s laws seem to have carried little weight and were rarely followed at the time, and despite the fact that his empire disintegrated soon after his death, his reign was a turning point for southern Mesopotamia. He firmly established the ideal of a unified state, centered in Babylon, and his laws were copied by Mesopotamian scribes until at least the 6th century 
bce. They show many points of 
similarity with, and may have influenced, laws of the Hebrew Bible, which in turn influence laws in many societies today. 
■Hammurabi the  
Law-GiverIn around 2000 bce, the Amorites 
(Westerners), a semi-nomadic 
people from Syria, swept across Mesopotamia, replacing local rulers with Amorite sheikh dynasties in many of the city-states. By the early 18th century 
bce, the three most powerful 
Amorite kings were pre-eminent Shamshi-Adad in the north, Rim-Sin in Larsa in the south,  and Hammurabi in Babylon in the center. Over the course of his long reign, Hammurabi consolidated all of southern Mesopotamia into his kingdom and eventually extended his power as far up the Tigris as Nineveh, and as far up the Euphrates as Tuttul, on the junction with the river Balikh. He personally supervised the construction of many temples and other buildings.
The prelude to his code, a 
tribute to Hammurabi, and  
a long historical record of his conquests, boasts that his leadership was divinely sanctioned by the gods who passed control of humanity to Marduk (deity of Babylon), and so to its king. It also reveals he saw his role as the guarantor  
of a just and orderly society.

 THE TEMPLES OF ABU SIMBEL ( c.1264 bce)
Around 1264 bce, the 
Egyptian pharaoh 
Ramesses II (c.1278–1237 
bce) had two mighty temples hewn 
out of the cliffs on the west bank  of the Nile in southern Egypt. The entrance was guarded by four vast statues of the pharaoh, seated in glory and wearing the symbols  of divine kingship, including the double crown that signified his authority over Upper and Lower Egypt. The temples were designed to signify and embody the unique status, ambition, and power of the ancient Egyptian pharaohs. 
The pharaonic tradition
Ramesses II inherited a tradition that was already very ancient: about 1,800 years earlier, King Narmer (called Menes by the ancient Greek historian Herodotus) first unified the kingdoms of the Upper (southern) and Lower (northern) Nile. Narmer’s deeds were recorded on a stone palette, which was recovered from a temple at Hierakonpolis in the 19th century and provides one of the earliest known depictions of an Egyptian king. The palette is inscribed with many of the symbols and traditions that would come to typify the pharaohs for the next three millennia. For instance, Narmer  is shown holding an enemy by  the hair, about to smite him, and Ramesses II was often depicted  in the same way—military might and supernatural strength were hallmarks of Egyptian kingship. The pharaoh, like the gods, was frequently shown much larger  than ordinary mortals.

The pharaoh was viewed as a living god who could control the order of the cosmos, including the annual flooding of the Nile, which brought fertilizing silt to replenish the soil. Pharaohs were also often depicted as farmers in agricultural scenes, representing their role as guardians of the land.  
The Old Kingdom
The Old Kingdom that followed Narmer was ruled by a succession of dynasties that were led by powerful pharaohs, who channeled the bureaucratic and economic might of the unified kingdom into monumental building projects, such as the construction of the pyramids. These, in turn, stimulated scientific, technological, and economic development, increasing trade with other kingdoms in the Near East and the Mediterranean. In the Old Kingdom the predominant gods were Ra, the sun god; Osiris, the god of the dead; and Ptah, the creator.

By this time, immortality was believed to be available not just to the pharaoh, but to priests, scribes, and others who could afford offerings, spells, and mummification, and many tombs were dug into the Valley of the Kings to be filled with extraordinarily rich grave goods. 
Under expansionist pharaohs, 
such as Thutmose III and Ramesses II, Egyptian control was extended into Asia as far as the Euphrates River, and up the Nile into Nubia.  It was no coincidence that Ramesses built Abu Simbel in Nubia: as well as representing the divine glory of Egypt’s pharaohs generally, the temple was a symbol of Ramesses’ control over the recently conquered territory.

By this time, immortality was believed to be available not just to the pharaoh, but to priests, scribes, and others who could afford offerings, spells, and mummification, and many tombs were dug into the Valley of the Kings to be filled with extraordinarily rich grave goods. 
Under expansionist pharaohs, 
such as Thutmose III and Ramesses II, Egyptian control was extended into Asia as far as the Euphrates River, and up the Nile into Nubia.  It was no coincidence that Ramesses built Abu Simbel in Nubia: as well as representing the divine glory of Egypt’s pharaohs generally, the temple was a symbol of Ramesses’ control over the recently conquered territory.

 SIDDARTHA GAUTAMA  
 PREACHES BUDDHISM ( c.500 bce)
Siddartha Gautama, better 
known as the Buddha, was born at the end of the Vedic 
Age (1800–600 
bce) into a South 
Asia in transition. In the country’s caste system, the priestly Brahmins and the warrior-elite Kshatriyas ranked highest, and it was into  
this latter group that Siddartha Gautama was born.
India was then a ferment of sects 
and new ideologies, some of which espoused a philosophy renouncing the material world. Siddartha developed a similar philosophy based on mystical Hinduism, but  he also rejected the increasingly rigid strictures of Vedic ritual and the inherited piety of the Brahmins. Renouncing material possessions, he sought and eventually found enlightenment, and became the Buddha. He preached in northeast India and founded the Sangha—the monastic order of Buddhism—to continue his ministry. IN CONTEXT

 A CLUE TO THE  
EXISTENCE OF A SYSTEM  
OF PICTURE-WRITING  
IN THE GREEK LANDS
 THE PALACE AT KNOSSOS ( c.1700 bce)
In the 1890s, British historian 
Arthur Evans came across some ancient clay seals for sale 
in Athens. They originated from the relatively unexplored Mediterranean island of Crete, and for Evans they offered a tantalizing hint at the existence of the first writing system in Europe. 
Following the seals to their 
Cretan source, Evans decided to excavate a promising parcel of  
land at Knossos, in the north of the island, where he uncovered a vast palace complex. The iconography  
of the palace centered on a bull-cult, including frescoes that depicted the sport of bull-leaping. Evans named the civilization “Minoan” after the mythical Cretan King Minos, who—according to Greek legend—built a labyrinth to contain the Minotaur: a fearsome half-man, half-bull creature. In the process, Evans discovered that the Minoans had indeed invented an early type of alphabet, which he called Linear A.

in what is known as the Palatial Period of the Minoan civilization, palaces at Knossos, Phaistos, Malia, and Chania had been constructed in broadly similar forms, with the one at Knossos being the largest.  It was destroyed, possibly by fire or perhaps a tsunami, around 1700 
bce, 
but it was rebuilt soon after on the same site. At its peak, in about 1500 
bce, Knossos palace and the 
city that grew up around it covered 185 acres (75 hectares) and had a population of up to 12,000. 
The Minoan palaces all had large 
central courts, flanked by many-chambered buildings, and were highly decorated with frescoes of flora and fauna. In the extensive magazines (storehouses), the rulers—who may have served dual roles as priest-kings or priest-queens—  
gathered many commodities for redistribution. Minoan rulers also controlled trade with other Bronze Age civilizations around the Mediterranean, such as Byblos in Phoenicia (now Lebanon), Ugarit  
in Syria, pharaonic Egypt, and Mycenaean Greek settlements in the Cyclades and further afield. 
Linear A script
The Minoans developed their own script, probably initially for record-keeping and administration purposes. It began as hieroglyphic picture-writing, but later evolved into the Linear A syllabary, in which symbols denote syllables (rather than letters, as is the case with the alphabet). The Minoan language as recorded in Linear A script remains undeciphered to this day, but in around 1450 
bce the Minoans were 
invaded by the Mycenaeans from mainland Greece, who adapted the Minoan script into Linear B, which was used to write archaic Greek.
Not long after the Mycenaeans 
invaded Crete, Minoan civilization collapsed completely. However, the legacy of Minoan writing lives on through its connection with the Phoenician alphabet, which in turn would come to form the basis of the Latin alphabet that is used in many parts of the world today. 
■The Phaistos disc
Found in 1908 in the ruins of 
the Minoan palace at Phaistos, southern Crete, the Phaistos disc (shown above), made from fired clay and about 6in (15cm) across, is printed with symbols in an unknown script. Although dated to 1700 
bce, it 
was made using the technique of woodblock printing, which was not thought to have been invented for another 2,000 years or so (in China), making the disc one of the great archaeological mysteries. The symbols, many of which are recognizable as everyday objects, are arranged in a spiral and divided into words by vertical lines. Some scholars have drawn parallels between certain symbols in Cretan hieroglyphics and Linear A, suggesting that the writing on the disc may be an elaborated form of an existing Minoan script. There are many theories about the disc’s significance—  
some consider the inscription is a hymn to a goddess, others that it tells a story, or that the disc is a calendar or a game. Some experts even believe the disc to be a clever fake.

IN WAR IT IS THE FATHERS   
 WHO BURY THEIR SONS
 THE PERSIAN WARS ( 490–449 bce)
Leonidas of Sparta  
stood before his band  of 300 warriors facing the 
mightiest army the world had  ever seen. The envoy of his enemy demanded that he lay down his arms at the feet of the Persian  god-king. “Come and take them” was Leonidas’s laconic reply.
The Persian Wars (490–449 
bce), 
also known as the Greco–Persian Wars, pitted a vast and cosmopolitan empire against a small band of  city-states in the south of Greece.  
The conflict profoundly influenced the development of Classical Greek identity and culture, leaving a vivid trail in Western literature and myth. By contrast, the story of the Persian Achaemenid Empire remains comparatively neglected, belying the significance of that great Middle Eastern civilization. 
The Achaemenids
The first Persian Empire, ruled  by the dynasty known as the Achaemenids, grew rapidly. At its height it may have ruled over half the world’s population. It began in around 550 
bce, when the Persian 
king Cyrus the Great overthrew the ruling Medes, going on to conquer Babylonia, and Lydia (now in Turkey), which brought the Ionian Greeks under Persian rule. Cyrus’s successors Cambyses II and Darius extended the empire into Egypt and the Balkans, where Thrace and Macedon gave the Persians  a foothold in Europe.  
The Achaemenids established 
Persian rule as a model for later empires. Despite its vast size, the state embraced a degree of multi-culturalism, allowing conquered peoples to keep liberty of religion, language, and culture. There was investment in infrastructure—like A hoplite —or Greek citizen-solider—

Cyrus the Great The founder of the Achaemenid 
Empire was Cyrus II, later known as “the Great.” In around 557

he became king of Anshan,  
a vassal of the Median king.
According to legend, he won 
the Persian army’s support by making them spend one day clearing thorn bushes, and the next banqueting, then asking  
why they remained slaves to the Medes when, by backing his revolt, they could live in luxury. 
Some ten years later he had 
conquered Media, and Sardis and Lydia in Asia Minor. He conquered Babylon seven years after that by diverting the Euphrates and marching his army along the dry riverbed into the great city. This victory brought him the lands of the neo-Babylonian Empire, including Assyria, Syria, and Palestine. He liberated the Jews from their Babylonian bondage and allowed them to rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. The Greek writer Xenophon saw him as an example of the ideal ruler.

heroic defense of Leonidas and his  300 Spartans at Thermopylae,  and by Greek naval resistance at Artemisium. Later the Athenian navy lured the Persian fleet into a trap at Salamis. Xerxes returned to Persia, leaving a large force to carry on the fight, but at the Battle of Plataea in 479

the Spartans, crushed the Persians, who also lost to the Spartans at Mycale. Greek success can probably be ascribed to Xerxes’ difficulties in keeping his vast army supplied and supported after naval defeat, although Herodotus ascribed it to the moral superiority of their cause.

The term “democracy” 
comes from the Greek words demos  (people) and 
kratos  (rule). The democracy that 
developed in ancient Athens around 507 
bce and flourished in  
its purest form from 462 to 322 bce, 
albeit with some interruptions, provided the model for what has become the dominant form of government in the world: by 2015, 125 of the world’s 195 countries were electoral democracies. The democracy of ancient Athens, however, differed from its modern form, reflecting the history of Athens and the warring Greek states of the age. 
Oligarchs and hoplites
After the chaos of the ancient Greek Dark Ages—a period that followed the breakdown of Mycenaean civilization around  1100 
bce and lasted until about  
the 9th century bce—most of the 
emergent city-states evolved into oligarchies, with powerful nobles monopolizing government and serving their own interests. In Athens, the Areopagus—a council and law court consisting of men of aristocratic birth—controlled the machinery of state, appointing officials and serving as a civil court, while the lower classes (thetes ) were excluded from office. 
However, the development of the 
“hoplite” model of citizen-soldiery in the 8th to 7th centuries 
bce proved 
disruptive to those who were in power, as it led to a certain level of egalitarianism. Hoplites were men in the heavy infantry, mainly free citizens, whose primary tactic was the phalanx—a military formation in which soldiers stood in tightly packed ranks, with each man’s shield protecting the hoplite to his left. Any man who could afford the arms and armor would be putting his life on the line to defend the state. As a result, a kind of middle class emerged, which declared that service should bring full citizenship and political representation. At the same time, the lower classes were also making demands, and tensions between them and the higher orders over key issues, such as land reform and debt slavery, threatened to lead to civil breakdown.
Solon and Cleisthenes
In Athens, some of these tensions were eased around 594 
bce by the 
reforms of the statesman Solon. He Pericles
Pericles (c.495–429 bce) became 
Athens’ most famous democrat 
and the leading man of the city-state for about 30 years.  
He came to prominence around  
462 
bce, when he helped the 
politician Ephialtes dismantle the Areopagus—the last bastion of oligarchic control. After Ephialtes’ death, Pericles undertook further reforms, including the introduction of pay for those serving in the courts, making it possible for even the poorest citizen to have his say. He is also believed to have helped drive Athens’ assertive foreign policy as the city sought to exploit its dominance of the Delian League. During the  
440s and 430s 
bce, Pericles  
was involved in an ambitious public building program that provoked controversy at home, where he fought off revolt, and abroad, where he was condemned for requisitioning money from the Delian League to pay for the Parthenon. Nonetheless, he was popular and was elected as general 
every year from 443

excluded. In the 4th century bce, 
out of the 300,000-strong total 
population of Attica—the region of Greece controlled by Athens—just 30,000 men comprised the voting population. In theory, men became voting citizens at age 18, but as they were generally liable for two years of military service they were not enrolled on the rosters of the council until they turned 20, and did not come into their full political rights until the age of 30.

temple (the Parthenon) on the rocky hill known as the Acropolis. Citizenship of Athens was highly coveted, and in 451 
bce Pericles 
passed a law restricting it to men whose parents were both Athenians.
A center of philosophy
As well as being the most powerful city-state in ancient Greece, Athens was also the crucible of  a revolutionary new direction in philosophy, in large part due to Socrates (c.469–399 
bce). Earlier 
Greek philosophers, collectively known as the pre-Socratics, had introduced a revolution of their own in human thought in the 5th and 6th centuries 
bce. They rejected 
supernatural explanations for the Our ordinary citizens, though

of industry, are still fair

separation of powers. This was essential to make the practical operation of direct democracy possible. It also ensured that all citizens (men aged 20 and above) could serve and that power could not be abused.

Socrates turned his enquiries 
inward to more human matters— as Cicero said of him, “he brought philosophy down from heaven.” Socrates’ method was simply to ask questions—What is friendship? What is justice? What is knowledge? The Socratic method tended to lay bare the limits of existing thinking, often making people look foolish or pompous. Accordingly, Socrates was unpopular and eventually he was accused of two crimes by his enemies—corrupting youth by encouraging them to go against the government, and impiety, or lack of respect for the gods. Consequently, he was sentenced to death. 
Socrates’ successors
The fate of Socrates was taken as an indictment of democracy by his successors, particularly Plato (c.428–348 
bce), who saw him as  
a martyr for truth. Plato ran a school (the Academy) and developed  
ideas about universal truths and metaphysics that have shaped all subsequent religion and philosophy in the Western world. His student Aristotle (384–322 
bce) became 
equally influential, setting up the Lyceum school and writing on such diverse topics as politics, ethics, law, and natural sciences. 
Plato opposed democracy, as  
he believed that the people were not sufficiently equipped with philosophical grace to legislate and if governance were left in the hands of the ordinary, citizen tyranny would emerge. In his ideal republic, enlightened philosophers would rule as kings. He also challenged the basic principle of democracy—that of liberty ( eleutheria )—which 
he believed could divert people from the proper pursuit of ethics and cause social disunity. 
The fall of democracy
During the Peloponnesian War (431–404 
bce), in which Athens was 
ultimately defeated by the Spartans, Athenian democracy was twice suspended, in 411 and 404 
bce. 
Athenian oligarchs claimed that ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS
Athens’ weak position was due  to democracy and led a counter-revolution to replace democratic rule with an extreme oligarchy. In both cases, democratic rule was restored within one year. 
Democracy flourished for the 
next eight decades. However, after the Macedonian conquest of Athens under Philip II and his son Alexander (later Alexander the Great) in 322 
bce, Athenian 
democracy was abolished. It was intermittently restored in the Hellenistic age in the 1st and 2nd centuries 
bce, but the Roman 
conquest of Greece in 146 bce 
effectively killed it off. 
Although democratic rule had 
been quashed, Athenian science and philosophy lived on. The renown and influence of Plato  and Aristotle endured through  the ages that followed, and much  of their work continues to influence Western thought to this day.

THE CONQUESTS OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT  
(4TH CENTURY bce)
In one of the fastest and most 
daring military expansions in history, Alexander the Great, 
the young king of Macedon in the Balkans, blazed a trail of conquest across most of the known world of his day, and set in motion a process of Hellenization—the spread of Greek culture and its fusion with non-Greek, Eastern traditions—which endured for centuries. 
Alexander’s father, Philip II, had 
transformed this peripheral state into a formidable military power, and had waged campaigns against  his neighbors that culminated in Macedon’s domination over all of Greece. When he was assassinated in 336 
bce, Philip had been planning 
an expedition to West Asia, to free the former Greek city-states now ruled by the world’s superpower, the Persian Empire. After securing the Macedonian throne by destroying his rivals, Alexander set about pursuing his father’s quest, while satisfying his own thirst for glory. 
King of the world
After forcing the other Greek city-states to accept his authority, in 334 
bce Alexander marched into 
Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) at the head of an army of 43,000 foot soldiers and 5,500 cavalry. At its heart lay the Macedonian phalanx, a well-drilled, tight-knit corps of 15,000 men armed with the sarissa , 
a pike that was up to 23ft (7m)  long. When combined with the shocking cavalry charge provided by the king’s personal bodyguard, the Companions, the formation proved irresistible. 
After an initial victory over the 
Persians at the River Granicus in the northwest, Alexander pressed on across Asia Minor. He stopped at Gordium in the central kingdom of Phrygia, where tradition held that he who could untie a complex

The Spring and Autumn Period 
gave way to the Warring States Period (476–221 
bce), in which 
power was consolidated into the hands of seven kingdoms: Qi, Chu, Yan, Han, Zhao, Wei, and Qin. At this point in China’s history it was by no means certain that an over-arching Chinese identity or state would emerge. If anything, it was more likely that the considerable geographical, climatic, cultural, and ethnic differences between  the various kingdoms would see the region develop in a similar fashion to Europe many centuries later, with multiple distinct and divergent national entities. 
The rise of Qin
In 247 bce, a 13-year-old prince 
named Ying Zheng succeeded to the throne of Qin. He inherited a militarized state, in which effective bureaucracy, powerful armies, and competent generals combined to produce a formidable and ruthless war machine. Zheng had rivals executed or exiled, appointed very effective generals and counselors, and conquered the six other states in the region, so that by 221

seven states were unified under his rule. Disdaining the old title of king (Wang), he styled himself as emperor (Huangdi). Since he was the first (Shi) emperor of the Qin dynasty,  he was known as Qin Shi Huangdi.
The governing philosophy of the 
Qin state had been legalism: strict centralization of power and severity in enforcing adherence to the law. The emperor now set about applying this philosophy throughout the whole of China, ruthlessly imposing cultural, linguistic, economic, and technological unity. All scripts except Xiaozhuan (small seal script) were banned. In addition, according to legend, the emperor gave orders for 400 Confucian scholars to be buried alive and all existing books to be burned; his reign was to mark a new “Year One” in the history and culture of China. He also introduced a host of economic reforms—there was to be a single, unified system of weights and measures, a uniform coinage, and even the gauge of cart tracks was standardized so that axle-widths could be the same across the empire.

relocated to the emperor’s capital 
city Xianyang (near Xi’an, in the Shaanxi province), and their arms were confiscated, melted down, and then cast into giant statues. During the Warring States Period, the pressure of incessant military competition had generally favored the emergence of more meritocratic avenues for advancement, thereby facilitating social mobility while undermining the importance of noble lineage. In the Qin dynasty, aristocratic rule was replaced  with a centralized bureaucratic administration and the country was divided into 36 commanderies, which were administrative divisions controlled by appointed (not hereditary) governors. Censors, or inspectors, traveled the country to enforce adherence to Qin law. 
The Qin dynasty also saw the 
emergence of a new scheme of social stratification, with society divided into four classes: gentlemen (Shi), peasants ( Nong ), and two 
new classes that had emerged during the Zhou dynasty—artisans (Gong ) and merchants ( Shang ). The 
educated gentry would replace  the nobility as the main source of state officials. The merchant class was officially the lowest and most despised of the orders, and was subject to legal discrimination; however, wealthy merchants were able to use their financial muscle to become important political players. 
Great works
Among Qin Shi Huangdi’s greatest achievements were his ambitious civil engineering projects, although there was a great human cost as many lost their lives in the process. THE FIRST EMPEROR UNIFIES CHINA

Shi Huangdi, these life-sized terracotta soldiers were discovered in 1974 by workers digging a well. The figures were originally brightly painted and each has a unique facial expression.He is traditionally credited with 
building the first part of the Great Wall of China, to keep out nomadic tribes in the north, by connecting parts of old walls erected by the Warring States and then adding thousands of miles of new wall.Other projects included constructing the Lingqu canal, which linked the Xiang and Li rivers so military supplies could be transported from northern to southern China, and building military roads including “the Straight Road,” which was  497 miles (800 km) long and ran from Xianyang to the Great Wall. 
Most famous of all the emperor’s 
ventures was the construction of his own elaborate mausoleum complex, which took 38 years and over 700,000 workers to construct. It consisted of a giant pyramid covered in earth to create an immense mound, 328 ft (100 m) high and 1,640 ft (500 m) across. Within the pyramid was a tomb in which his beloved empire was recreated in miniature, complete with liquid mercury rivers and seas. Buried around the tomb were large pits filled with thousands of life-sized terracotta warriors, bureaucrats, and entertainers, all intended to serve the emperor in the afterlife. Workers on the tomb were killed after completing their tasks so the secrets of the mausoleum’s location and contents died with them, and the tomb remained undiscovered for over 2,000 years.

bringing the 500-year-old Roman Republic to an end in all but name.
Republican origins
From its ancient beginnings as a cluster of small villages on seven hills by the River Tiber, Rome grew into a city-state that was just one  of many on the Italian peninsula. According to legend, Rome was first ruled by kings, but in 509 
bce, 
the monarchy was overthrown and  it became a republic. A new constitution allowed the election of two top officials, known as consuls, to run the state, but in order to prevent abuse of power, their term was limited to one year. The office of king was also prohibited, and special provision was made for the appointment of a dictator to replace the consuls in times of crisis—his term being limited to six months.

was a Mediterranean superpower, yet its long tradition of collective government, in which no individual could gain too much control, was being challenged by the personal ambitions of a few immensely powerful military men.

The republic crumbles
In the period in which Julius Caesar came to prominence on  the Roman political scene (around 70 
bce), Rome was in turmoil: beset 
with ever worsening social and economic problems and torn by political conflict. Early in Rome’s history, the non-slave population had been officially split into two classes: the patricians (members  of the ancient hereditary nobility and wealthy landowners) and the  plebeians, or plebs for short (the common people). On the formation of the republic, only patricians  had been entitled to hold office in  the Senate—Rome’s governing and advisory council—but in 368–367 
bce, a constitutional amendment 
allowed the election of wealthier plebs too, and the result was a power-sharing arrangement.
However, in reality, a small 
group of patrician families known as the Optimates (the “Best Men”) had long dominated the Senate and jealously guarded their privileges. In the late Roman Republic, those who championed the rights of the plebs—the Populares (the “People’s Men”)—sought popular support against the Optimates, either in the interests of the people themselves, or more often, in pursuit of their own careers. The self-interested Optimates resisted making the social and economic reforms that were urgently required to meet the changing needs of the Roman people. In Italy and the provinces an unequal system of taxation and corrupt governance were causing social unrest, while in the city of Rome itself, the infrastructure was barely able to cope with a growing population. The empire’s rapid expansion had brought a flood of

slave labor from the provinces, 
driving many Roman farm workers and smallholders off the land and into the city in search of work. 
The rise of Julius Caesar
Meanwhile, a handful of military leaders in Rome’s provinces had begun to use their armies to jockey for political prominence. Among them was Julius Caesar, a highly intelligent and ambitious general from a patrician family who had aligned himself with the Populares and risen swiftly through the political ranks. Caesar was intent on making the reforms necessary  to meet the challenges of the republic, and so he maneuvered himself into a position that would allow him to achieve his goal.  
In 60 
bce, Caesar became 
consul, and two years later he was appointed governor of the province of Gaul, a role which enabled him  to remain abreast of developments in the Senate while also offering a springboard to military glory. In a series of masterful campaigns over the next eight years, he conquered Gaul, bringing the whole of what  is now France, along with parts of Germany and Belgium, under his rule. He also led two expeditions to Britain, in 55 and 54 
bce. Caesar’s 
heroic military exploits left him immensely rich and increased his personal prestige; he enjoyed the loyalty of his armies and the love  of the Roman mob, upon whom he could now afford to lavish feasts, games, and money.  
Buoyed by his achievements, 
Caesar attempted to dictate the terms on which he would return  to Roman politics, demanding to  be allowed to stand for a second consulship while remaining in command at Gaul. This put him  on a collision course with the Optimates in the Senate, since Roman law required military leaders to relinquish control of their armies before entering Rome, a prerequisite for running for office. Caesar knew that if he agreed to enter the city as a private citizen, without his armies, his political opponents would most likely attempt to try him for abuse of power during his first consulship. 
Back in Rome, the Optimates, 
alarmed by the implications of Caesar’s meteoric rise, allied themselves to one of his main political rivals, the renowned THE ASSASSINATION OF JULIUS CAESAR
general Pompey. The Senate passed laws intending to strip Caesar of his command when he returned from Gaul, and in 49 
bce they 
declared him hostis , or public 
enemy. In response to this direct threat, Caesar did the unthinkable: he marched his army on Rome.  En route, he paused at the border between the Gallic provinces  and Italy proper: a small river called the Rubicon. Caesar was acutely aware that crossing the river would constitute a declaration of war against the Senate but, quoting the Even yet we may draw back, 
but once across that little 
bridge, and the whole issue  
is with the sword.

family of distinguished ancestry. From an early age, he grasped that money was the key to power in a political system that had become hopelessly corrupt. He also quickly learned that forging a network of alliance and patronage would be crucial to his success. 
After serving in the war to 
crush the slave revolt led by Spartacus in 72 
bce, Caesar was 
briefly taken hostage by pirates. Once he returned to Rome in  
60 
bce, Caesar spent vast sums  
on buying influence and positions, eventually teaming up with the two other leading men in Rome, Crassus and Pompey, to form the so-called First Triumvirate. Between 58 and 50 
bce, he 
formed a provincial power base in Gaul where, without the sanction of the Senate, he launched a series of campaigns that made him master of Western Europe, with fabulous wealth and powerful armies. However, these campaigns also earned him many opponents among the governing classes, who would eventually cut short both his career and his life.

Caesar’s new order
In the ensuing civil war, Caesar finally triumphed over Pompey’s forces at the Battle of Pharsalus  in northern Greece in 48 
bce.  
The defeated Pompey fled to Egypt for sanctuary, where he was later assassinated. After crushing the remaining pockets of resistance, Caesar finally returned to Rome in 45 
bce, to consolidate his political 
position. In 46 bce he accepted the 
dictatorship for 10 years; two years later, he was granted the office for life. Now in a position to begin the monumental task of reconstructing the Roman state and restoring stability to the empire, Caesar initiated far-reaching social and political reforms. He extended Roman citizenship; he enlarged  the Senate, bringing in allies from among the provincial aristocracy; he established colonies outside Italy, to help spread Roman culture and knit the empire together; he spent lavishly on grandiose public works and buildings; he cut taxes; and he even reformed the Roman calendar, introducing the system of leap years that is still in use today.
A murder plot
Caesar’s pragmatic solutions for re-establishing unity in the empire after years of chaos found favor with many parts of society, yet  at the same time, his increasingly autocratic attitude to power was alienating fellow members of the ruling class. They felt that Caesar was trying to destroy the cherished traditions of the Roman state, and to undermine the prestige of the nobility, and spread the rumor that he was planning to make himself king. Unfortunately, Caesar failed to  quell the suspicions. He accepted unprecedented honors, such as assuming the title “Imperator” (“Victorious General”) as a family name; he also allowed temples and statues to be erected in his honor, and had coins minted bearing his image. And when he adopted his grand-nephew, Octavian, there were fears that he was trying to establish a dynastic succession. Some members of the Senate concluded that the only solution  to the problem was to assassinate Caesar, and so they hatched a conspiracy to carry it out.ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS
Representing those opposed to the dictator’s reforms—and the leading agent in the plot to murder him—Gaius Cassius Longinus was a general who had risen to political prominence during a largely disastrous campaign in Persia. Ancient Roman historians argued that Cassius’s involvement was prompted by a combination of jealousy and greed. He is also said to have recruited the most important conspirator, Marcus Junius Brutus, a trusted colleague and confidante of Caesar, opposed to the dictator’s presumed monarchic ambitions.

Death of a dictator
The assassination plot grew rapidly, 
eventually including 60 senators, among them many of Caesar’s close colleagues. The plotters decided  to strike at a meeting of the Senate that had been called for March 15, (the Ides of March). On the day, they gathered at Cassius’s home, each senator concealing a dagger beneath his robes, before moving on to Pompey’s Theatre—part of a great civic complex that Caesar’s old rival had constructed—where  the Senate was meeting. A group  of gladiators had been stationed in the theatre itself, to help control any crowd problems. However, many of the conspirators were nervous and ready to flee, convinced that the plot had been uncovered. 
Caesar had indeed been warned: 
a list of the plotters had been thrust into his hands, but he ignored it. His wife pleaded with him not to attend the Senate meeting, but one of the conspirators, stationed at Caesar’s house, helped calm her fears. When Caesar arrived at the meeting, a conspirator distracted his deputy, Mark Anthony, delaying him outside the theatre. As Caesar took his seat, the conspirators drew their daggers and struck, stabbing him 23 times. In an ironic twist, Caesar breathed his last slumped against the base of a statue of his old rival Pompey. 
The Second Triumvirate
Seized with manic fervor, the conspirators dipped their hands  in Caesar’s blood and rushed out into the Forum to proclaim their tyrannicide. In the power vacuum that followed, Mark Anthony, and Caesar’s heir, Octavian, promptly assumed control of the state, forming in 43 
bce a triumvirate (a group  
of three men holding power) with Lepidus, one of Caesar’s former allies. 
Needing to gather enough funds 
to stabilize their authority, and to remove political opposition, the triumvirate drew up a list of those who had supported Caesar’s murderers, and declared them outlaws. Around 200 senators and more than 2,000 equites (“knights” or minor nobility) were either killed or had their estates confiscated. The treasury’s coffers now filled, the triumvirate hunted down and destroyed Brutus and Cassius.In 40 
bce, the triumvirs met again, 
this time to carve up the Roman world. Africa was given to Lepidus, the East to Mark Anthony, and the West to Octavian. However, it was THE ASSASSINATION OF JULIUS CAESAR
not long before Octavian went to war against Anthony in north Africa, and, after defeating his forces at Actium in western Greece in 31 
bce, Octavian became the 
master of the Roman world. 
Rome’s first emperor
Octavian returned to Rome in  28 
bce and, instead of following 
Caesar’s example, he renounced the dictatorial powers granted  to him in order to wage his war against Antony. In 27 
bce, in 
gratitude for his service to Rome, the Senate bestowed on him  the name Augustus (“revered personage”) and granted him wide-ranging legal powers. Eventually, through political sleight of hand,  he became Rome’s sole ruler,  controlling all aspects of the Roman state and command of the army. 
An emperor in all but name  
(he was careful to spurn such titles, styling himself instead as princeps, or “first citizen”), over the next  four decades, Augustus set about transforming the ruins of the republican system into an imperial autocracy, all the while maintaining the illusion that his authority  was dependent on the will of the  people. He loosely established the boundaries of the empire, pushed through reforms to clean up both private and public life, and crushed dissent. After the long periods of exhausting civil war, many in the empire were grateful for peace. 
The Pax Romana
Indeed the might of the Roman military and the consequent improvements in security and stability across a vast stretch of territory, in what became known as the Pax Romana (“Roman Peace”), led to a growth in trade, economic activity, population, and general prosperity. The arts and culture Caesar, like a most  
gentle physician, had been 
assigned to the Romans  
by Heaven itself.

Provincials were even granted full Roman citizenship after a period of military service.
However, for the regions beyond 
the bounds of empire, Augustus’s Pax Romana often meant just the opposite. Even after reducing the army from 80 legions to a permanent force of just 28, Augustus had to find employment for 150,000 soldiers.  
He launched a series of campaigns to extend borders, suppress and harry rebels and “barbarians,” and seize slaves from conquered areas.
An imperial legacy
By the end of his life in 14 ce, 
Augustus had established a new imperial system that would endure for centuries. For some years before his death, Augustus had prepared the way for an heir to succeed him, and retain control of the state. His step-son Tiberius was gradually ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS

a co-emperor. This smoothed the transition of authority on Augustus’ death, preventing a vacuum of power and ensuring continuity.   
Augustus thus established the 
principle of direct succession and ensured the survival of the office of emperor. The system continued through multiple dynasties, with the empire reaching its height under the Nerva-Antonine dynasty when the emperor Hadrian ordered the building of a wall in northern Britain to mark the empire’s outer limit.
The transition from republic to 
monarchy, while drastic, gave Rome a new stability. Masquerading as a democrat, Augustus created a new autocratic system of government, which, despite restricting political participation, was much better able to resist the compulsive upheavals that had plagued the Roman Republic a generation before.

BY THIS SIGN CONQUER
 THE BATTLE OF MILVIAN BRIDGE (312 ce)
In October 312 ce, Emperor 
Constantine I was stationed  
at the Milvian Bridge near 
Rome, waiting to join battle with Maxentius, his rival for control of the Western Roman Empire (in 285, the empire had been split into two halves, eastern and western, each ruled by an emperor and a deputy).Tradition says that in the days before the encounter, Constantine had a vision of a flaming cross in the heavens bearing the inscription  
in hoc signo vinces (“by this sign conquer”). This convinced him that he had the support of the god of  the Christians, and this belief was upheld when his army went on to defeat Maxentius’s men. In fact,  the Christian god was not the first deity Constantine had auditioned; an earlier version of his vision had involved the Greek and Roman god Apollo. He appears to have been looking for theological “back-up” to legitimize his ambition to become sole emperor, and a monotheistic supreme being may have seemed  to him a good fit: a heavenly mirror image of his own position on Earth. 
Constantine I’s adoption of 
Christianity after his victory at the Milvian Bridge gave the faith a huge boost: it rapidly gained more followers and began edging out the pagan cults.IN CONTEXT

Despite the legend of his divine 
vision, Constantine’s conversion  to Christianity seems to have been gradual rather than immediate—he was not baptized until many years later, on his deathbed. However, soon after his victory at the Milvian Bridge, he began the process of rehabilitating, and then exalting, Christianity; in 331 
ce, he issued 
the Edict of Milan, a proclamation that established religious toleration for Christianity within the empire. 
A multi-faith empire
For almost 300 years after the life  of Jesus Christ, the religion based on his teachings remained a minor sect within the Roman Empire, practiced alongside many other faiths, both mono- and polytheistic. Some aspects of Christianity,  such as its egalitarian nature,  made it suspicious to the imperial authorities however, and Christians were periodically persecuted. 
All across the ancient world at 
this time, changing social, political, and economic conditions were reflected in cultural and religious changes; Christianity was just  one of a number of monotheisms gaining popularity in the Roman Empire, including the Persian cult of Mithraism, with which it had much in common. 
The rise of Christianity
In 324, after disposing of the emperor in the East, Constantine became sole ruler of the Roman Empire, and then sought to use Christianity as a unifying force across his diverse and fractious realm. To make the increasingly dominant eastern half easier to govern, he founded a new city called Constantinople (now Istanbul), consecrating it with both Christian and pagan rites, but allowing only Christian churches to be built. Although it would take time for  all Roman citizens to convert to Christianity, in Constantine’s reign, the higher ranks of society, seeking political advancement and personal favor with the emperor, flocked to the Church, and the emperor built basilicas across the empire. 
Christianity, however, was not a 
single, uniform religion at this time, and splits, or schisms, formed.  In 325, Constantine convened  the Council of Nicaea—the first universal council of the Christian Church—mainly to settle the Arian schism, a theological dispute over whether Jesus was of the same substance as God. 
Rome is Christianized
In the mid-300s, Emperor Julian, an adherent of the old religion, tried  to revive paganism, but it was too late: Christians had become a majority, at least in the East. The faith was increasingly bound up with empire, as the Roman state adopted and molded the Church into an instrument of social and political control, unity, and stability.
Under Emperor Theodosius I 
(reigned 379–395), pagan temples and cults were suppressed, heresy was outlawed, and Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire. Eventually, it also became the faith of the barbarian successor states in the Roman Western Empire, as well as of the Byzantine Empire in the East. Over the course of many centuries, the western (Catholic) and eastern (Orthodox) churches grew apart  in doctrine and organization, but Christianity endured.

Although Rome had already ceased to be the capital of the Western Roman Empire and the destruction was relatively restrained, the sack sent shock waves across the world.

kingdoms, which in many cases 
gave rise to the nations of the modern era. Climatic changes in Central Asia drove the nomadic horse tribes of the steppes to seek better pastures, which in turn forced neighboring nomads to invade the so-called civilized empires. China was ravaged by the Xiongnu, Persia by the Hepthalites, and India by the White Huns.
Barbarians at the gates
In Europe, the arrival of the Huns  in the lands east of the Rhine and north of the Danube displaced Germanic tribes who had long lived in delicate balance with the Roman Empire. The Visigoths moved into Roman lands, eventually storming Rome in 410, while other tribes including the Vandals, Suevi, Alans, Franks, Burgundians, and Alemanni invaded and settled territory from Gaul to Spain to North Africa.  
In the 440s the Huns, under Attila, ravaged Eastern Europe before being defeated by a coalition of Romans and Germans. The Western Roman Empire shrank to encompass little more than Italy itself, its puppet emperors controlled by barbarian generals. In 476, the last nominal emperor was deposed by one such general, Odoacer, marking the end of the Roman Empire in the west.The Western Empire had however been in decline since at least the 3rd century. Its population and economy had diminished, making it increasingly financially dependent on the Eastern Empire; weakening central authority had given more autonomy to the provinces. The military, obliged to recruit from barbarian tribes, was losing its core strength. In reality, the Barbarian Invasions were probably part of a process: a transition, rather than  
a fall. Roman customs, culture, language, and particularly its religion in the form of Christianity, endured across the provinces, and many of the new ruling elite saw themselves as continuing in the tradition of Rome. The city itself survived sack by Alaric and his Visigoths, and by the Vandals in 455, and flourished under Theodoric the Ostrogoth (489–526). 
In their turn, the successor 
states formed by Germanic tribes over the following centuries eventually found themselves under attack by further waves of invaders such as the Magyars and Vikings.

signifying the unintelligible babble of those who did not speak Greek, and therefore could not be considered civilized. Romans adopted this “them-and-us” construction. However, by the 4th century, the boundaries between Rome and its barbarian neighbors were blurred, both culturally and geopolitically: the barbarians had become more like the Romans, and vice versa. The Roman army comprised mostly barbarians—either Germanic auxiliaries and mercenaries,  or Roman citizens who were actually Gauls, Britons, or one  
of the hundreds of other groups and ethnicities. Nevertheless, much Roman culture survived the invasions. For instance, although much of Italy, Gaul,  and Spain fell under the sway  
of the “Germanic” Goths,  
Suevi, and Vandals, their languages resisted Germanic influence and remain Romance languages—that is, languages that have evolved from the Latin spoken by Romans in Rome.

In Destruction  (c.1935) by Thomas 
Cole, invaders overrun a once-great 
city often likened to Rome. Citizens’ bodies litter monuments that were built to celebrate the now fallen civilization.See also: The assassination of Julius Caesar 58–65

kingdoms, which in many cases 
gave rise to the nations of the modern era. Climatic changes in Central Asia drove the nomadic horse tribes of the steppes to seek better pastures, which in turn forced neighboring nomads to invade the so-called civilized empires. China was ravaged by the Xiongnu, Persia by the Hepthalites, and India by the White Huns.
Barbarians at the gates
In Europe, the arrival of the Huns  in the lands east of the Rhine and north of the Danube displaced Germanic tribes who had long lived in delicate balance with the Roman Empire. The Visigoths moved into Roman lands, eventually storming Rome in 410, while other tribes including the Vandals, Suevi, Alans, Franks, Burgundians, and Alemanni invaded and settled territory from Gaul to Spain to North Africa.  
In the 440s the Huns, under Attila, ravaged Eastern Europe before being defeated by a coalition of Romans and Germans. The Western Roman Empire shrank to encompass little more than Italy itself, its puppet emperors controlled by barbarian generals. In 476, the last nominal emperor was deposed by one such general, Odoacer, marking the end of the Roman Empire in the west.The Western Empire had however been in decline since at least the 3rd century. Its population and economy had diminished, making it increasingly financially dependent on the Eastern Empire; weakening central authority had given more autonomy to the provinces. The military, obliged to recruit from barbarian tribes, was losing its core strength. In reality, the Barbarian Invasions were probably part of a process: a transition, rather than  
a fall. Roman customs, culture, language, and particularly its religion in the form of Christianity, endured across the provinces, and many of the new ruling elite saw themselves as continuing in the tradition of Rome. The city itself survived sack by Alaric and his Visigoths, and by the Vandals in 455, and flourished under Theodoric the Ostrogoth (489–526). 
In their turn, the successor 
states formed by Germanic tribes over the following centuries eventually found themselves under attack by further waves of invaders such as the Magyars and Vikings.

THE INDUS VALLEY 
CIVILIZATION COLLAPSES
c.1900–1700 bce 
The Indus Valley Civilization  
(c.3300–c.1700 bce) was based 
around large cities with planned streets and impressive drainage and water-supply systems in what are now Pakistan and northwestern India. By 1900 
bce, this civilization 
was in decline and no longer producing the elaborate jewelry and fine seals for which it was famous. By c.1700 
bce, the great Indus cities 
of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro were virtually empty. The reason is unclear, but the most likely explanation is a combination of crop failure and a decline in trade with Egypt and Mesopotamia. There is also some evidence of flooding due to a change in the course of the Indus River. 
EMPEROR WU CLAIMS THE 
MANDATE OF HEAVEN
(1046 bce)
The idea that the emperor of China 
rules with the approval of heaven dates to the Zhou dynasty, which was founded when Wu and his ally Jiang Ziya defeated the long-ruling Shang at the Battle of Muye in 1046 
bce. The Shang had presided  
over a long period of peace and prosperity but by the 1040s had become corrupt. The Zhou concept of the Mandate of Heaven aimed  to prevent this from happening, placing good government above noble birth, and sanctioning others tools and ornamental objects in bronze, but they were also among the first in Europe to use iron for items such as swords. Their striking bronze jewelry bore intricate patterns featuring spirals, knotwork, and animal designs, which had a lasting influence on later Celtic art.
THE PELOPONNESIAN 
WARS
(431–404 bce)
The Peloponnesian Wars were 
fought between Athens (initially the most powerful Greek city- state and the center of classical civilization) and the more militaristic Sparta. Sparta first launched land-based attacks on Athens, while Athens used its superior sea power to suppress revolts along the coast. In 413 
bce, 
an attack on Syracuse, Sicily,  went wrong, leaving most of the Athenian force destroyed. Then  the Spartans, allied with Persia, supported rebellions in a number  of Athenian subject states and finally wiped out the Athenian fleet at Aegospotam (405 
bce). The war 
deeply damaged Athens, ending the golden age of Greek culture  and leaving Sparta dominant.
HANNIBAL INVADES ITALY
(218 bce)
By the 3rd century bce, Carthage,  
in Tunisia, had established  
itself as a major regional power, extending along the coast of North Africa before invading Spain in  FURTHER EVENTS
to overthrow the ruler if he did not display these qualities. It influenced the way the Chinese regarded their rulers for thousands of years.
JUDAH DEFIES THE 
ASSYRIANS
(c.700 bce)
In the 9th century bce, the Hebrew 
state of Judah (west of the Dead 
Sea) was part of the large Assyrian empire. In the 8th century, the Judaean ruler Hezekiah refused  to pay tribute to the Assyrians.  The Assyrian king, Sennacherib, laid siege to Jerusalem (an event described in the Bible), but the Judaeans resisted their mighty enemies, who failed to take the city. Although this was a relatively small setback for Assyria, it was a triumph for the Judaeans, who attributed their victory to Yahweh. This was a major factor in the Hebrew peoples’ adoption of monotheistic religion soon after.
CELTIC CULTURE 
FLOURISHES AT HALLSTATT
(c.650 bce)
In the 8th century bce, a distinctive 
culture developed around Hallstatt, 
southeast of modern Salzburg, in Austria. Hallstatt’s people were Celts, probably originally from Russia, and by the time their civilization reached its highest point, around 650 
bce, it had spread  
west to eastern France, east into Romania, and north to Bohemia and Slovakia. Its people produced fine

the 230s bce. In 218 bce, Hannibal, 
Carthage’s commander in Spain, took his army across the Alps to attack Italy. Despite a series of victories in what became known  as the Second Punic War, Hannibal could not take Rome itself and in 202 
bce, he returned to Africa.  
The Romans had proved their strength, put an end to the idea that Carthage was invincible in  the Mediterranean, and paved the  way for their own rise to power.
VERCINGETORIX IS 
DEFEATED AT ALESIA
(52 bce)
In 52 bce, the Gaulish chieftain 
Vercingetorix led a revolt of local 
tribes against the Roman conquest of Gaul (modern France). At the Battle of Alesia, in Burgundy (eastern France), Roman forces under Julius Caesar built an ingenious donut-shaped fortification around the town, blocking Vercingetorix inside  while also creating a stronghold against Gaulish reinforcements. The chieftain was forced to surrender, and after five years in captivity he was strangled on Caesar’s orders. The battle resulted in an all-embracing Roman Empire stretching right across Europe.
ROMANS OCCUPY BRITAIN
(43 ce)
In 43 ce, on the command of the 
emperor Claudius, a Roman invasion force landed in Britain.  In spite of opposition from local chieftains such as Caratacus, and  a later revolt by the Iceni tribe under their leader Boudica, Roman rule eventually extended across England to the Scottish border and into Wales. The Romans governed Britain until c.410, founding towns, developing a system of roads, and introducing such innovations as underfloor heating and the use of concrete for building. Many Britons benefited from Roman rule and from strong trading links with  the empire in products such as metals and grain. 
CHINA IS DIVIDED INTO  
THREE KINGDOMS 
(220 ce)
The last years of the Han dynasty in China were marked by bitter divisions and fighting that led in 220 
ce to the country being divided 
between three rival emperors,  
all claiming to be the rightful successors of the Han. These  
Three Kingdoms—the Wei in the north, the Wu in the south, and the Shu in the west—reached a fairly stable agreement over territory until fighting broke out from  
263, when the rival Jin dynasty challenged and then conquered them. The wars had a devastating impact on the population.
THE MAYA CLASSICAL

(250 ce)
The Maya civilization reached its 
Classic phase in the 3rd century

across Mexico and Guatemala  that featured distinctive temples shaped as stepped pyramids, carved monuments inscribed  
with dates from the complex  
Maya calendar, and a large and extensive trade network. The largest city was Teotihaucan in central Mexico, although lowland cities such as Tikal were also powerful. Maya civilization left a lasting mark in North and Central America, its culture influencing later peoples, such as the Aztecs.
OBELISKS ARE ERECTED  
IN THE KINGDOM OF AXUM
(4th century ce)
In the 4th century ce, the people of 
the Ethiopian city of Axum erected tall stone obelisks that would be a feature of their civilization. Axum dominated the maritime trade routes around the Horn of Arabia and into the Indian Ocean, offering traders a vital link between Asia and the Mediterranean making the kingdom an impressive income. The obelisks are up to 108 ft (33 m) tall and are thought to be memorials  
to prominent people. They testify  to the power of this early African kingdom and its development  of a distinctive civilization. The obelisks have become symbols  of enduring African culture.
CLOVIS UNITES GAUL
(late 5th century ce)
The end of Roman rule in Gaul (modern France) came about  when Clovis, leader of the Salian Franks, defeated the Roman leader Syagrius in 486 
ce. This victory, 
which added to those of Clovis’ father Childeric, brought virtually all of France north of the Loire under the rule of his dynasty,  called the Merovingians, after  his grandfather Merovech. The Merovingians ruled France for some 300 years, making real  the idea of a united France independent of outside rulers.

Historians call the period 
from 500 to 1500 “the Middle Ages,” seeing it as  
a separate era sandwiched between the ancient world and modern times. In reality, there was never a clear break with the ancient world. In the eastern Mediterranean, the Roman Empire continued for almost 1,000 years after the fall of Rome, although it was rebranded by historians as  the Byzantine Empire. The ancient tradition of a united China ruled by an emperor was revived in the 6th century and continued to the Ming dynasty, albeit with interruptions. Even in Western Europe, where the breakdown after the Roman Empire’s collapse was most evident, Christian religion survived in Rome as the key marker for the distinction between what were considered “civilized” and “barbarian” societies.The rise of Islam
The dominance of two mutually hostile monotheistic religions—Christianity and Islam—was the most distinctive characteristic of this period across much of Eurasia. The founding of Islam in the 7th century was a transformative event, and Arab armies inspired by the faith altered the political landscape: Muslim rule spread from Spain in the west to central Asia in the east.
Although a united Islamic 
caliphate could not be sustained, the religion ensured a continuity  of civilization even when power shifted from the Arabs to other peoples such as the Turks. The great cities of the Muslim world surpassed any in Christendom in size and sophistication, and Muslim scholars preserved the science of the ancient Greeks and built upon it. Islamic civilization remained dynamic and expansive throughout the entire medieval period. 
Western European fortunes
In Western Europe, civilization fell drastically from the level achieved under the Roman Empire. Warrior kings ruled over a thinly spread population sustained by subsistence agriculture, and the area remained prey to non-Christian raiders and invaders, such as the Vikings and the Magyars, into the 10th century. 
A nostalgia for ancient Rome  
led to King Charlemagne being crowned emperor in 800, but the Holy Roman Empire, based on  the tradition Charlemagne founded, failed to unify Western Europe politically. In the absence of strong centralized state systems, feudal relationships held societies together. INTRODUCTION

From the 11th century, a revival of Western European culture, trade, and urban life gathered pace. The “Medieval Warm Period” (950–1250), when Europe experienced above-average temperatures, improved yields from agriculture; it was also a time when great cathedrals and castles were constructed. But  even when the Christian crusaders fought their way to Jerusalem at the heart of the Muslim world, the flow of civilization was the other way, with Islamic scholars far advanced in medicine, philosophy, astronomy, and geography.
Expansion and contraction
By the 13th century, the world’s population is believed to have risen to around 400 million—double its total at the high point of the ancient empires. A wide-ranging network linked Europe to China and the thriving trading kingdoms of Asia, by land along the Silk Road and by sea across the Indian Ocean. Cairo and Venice both became wealthy cities as focal points at the western end of this trade. 
However, civilized life remained 
precarious. The Mongols—nomadic warriors from the Asian steppes—seized major cities from the Middle East to southern China, carrying out large-scale massacres. Lethal diseases were also highly prevalent. Carried along the trade routes in the mid-14th century, the Black Death epidemic may have killed a quarter of the world’s population.
Inventions and progress
Technological progress was slow but cumulatively substantial. As the world’s most advanced country, China was the ultimate source of most inventions, from paper and printing to the magnetic compass and gunpowder. Even relatively backward Europe benefited from improvements in shipbuilding and metalworking, and the invention and spread of the plow and the windmill transformed agriculture. 
By the end of the Middle Ages, 
Western European kingdoms had developed from “feudal” states, based on oaths of loyalty, to more stable and centralized states, able to channel their key resources into the large projects of colonization and exploration. In the Americas, meanwhile, civilizations such as the Aztecs and Incas continued to evolve independently, untouched by developments in Eurasia and Africa, until the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the 16th century.

SEEK TO ENLARGE THE 
EMPIRE AND MAKE IT 
MORE GLORIOUS
 BELISARIUS RETAKES ROME (536 ce)
On December 9, 536 ce, the 
army of the Eastern Roman 
(or Byzantine) Empire, led 
by general Belisarius, entered the city of Rome through the ancient Porta Asinaria gate. The Byzantine’s arrival forced the rapid departure of the city’s current defenders, the barbarian Ostrogoths, who were fleeing northward through the  Porta Flaminia. Almost precisely  60 years after Italy had fallen out of imperial hands, it appeared that the empire’s ancient birthplace might be restored to Roman rule.
The survival of Byzantium
While the Western Roman Empire finally fell in 476 after a century of barbarian invasions, the eastern portion—the Byzantine Empire, with its capital at Constantinople (modern Istanbul)—weathered the storm, its retention of rich provinces, such as Egypt, enabling it to mount a successful defense of its territory. However, the loss of the empire’s birthplace was a blow to the prestige of the Byzantine emperors, who refused to accept it. In 488, the Emperor Zeno despatched one  tribe of Germanic barbarian mercenaries, the Ostrogoths, to remove another, led by Odoacer, IN CONTEXT

The Gothic War
For the following 40 years, the Goths’ rule of Italy was relatively untroubled. However, the accession of Justinian (c.482–565) as Byzantine emperor in 527 changed things.  
To find money in Italy

Around 610 ce, in a cave in  
the hills above the town  
of Mecca, central Arabia, 
Muhammad—a 40-year-old man from a merchant family—declared that he had received a divine message from the angel Gabriel. This was followed by similar revelations over the coming months and years and led to the founding of a new monotheistic religion: Islam. Within 20 years, this creed had come to dominate the Arabian peninsula, and a century later its followers had shattered the ancient Byzantine and Persian Empires, creating a state that stretched from Spain in the far west to Central Asia in the east.

Arabia before Islam
From the first millennium bce there 
were sophisticated kingdoms in 
southern Arabia, which derived their wealth from the spice trade.  In the early days, the trade routes ran along the northwest coast,  
but by the 7th century these  had diminished as merchants increasingly used a maritime  route up the Red Sea, leaving many places that had been relatively prosperous in decline. There were  a few scattered towns, such as Medina (then known as Yathrib) and Mecca, which were dependent on more local trade in wool and leather, along with a few key imports such as grain and olive oil. The central desert regions of the Arabian peninsula were very poor: Bedouin tribes followed a nomadic lifestyle, and competition for scarce resources shaped a society in which primary loyalty was to  a kinship group, or tribe. 
At the time of Muhammad, 
Arabia was in a state of religious and political ferment. Strong Jewish communities had become established in Yemen in the south and in northwestern oasis towns, such as Medina, while Christianity had gained footholds in Yemen and eastern Arabia. Although monotheistic faiths were making inroads against the traditional polytheistic paganism of the Bedouin Arabs, paganism still remained strong. Conflict between tribes was also common, and in Mecca, in the sacred enclosure known as the haram , a truce was 
enforced so men of different tribes could trade freely without violence.

and practices such as female infanticide.

years violence had broken out 
between the established powers there and Muhammad’s supporters. Muhammad outmaneuvered the Qurayshi, first by raiding their caravans, then defeating them in  a pitched battle in 627, and finally negotiating the right to return to Mecca on a pilgrimage in 629. By the time he died in 632, Muhammad was re-established in Mecca, and his diplomatic and military successes in attracting other tribes to his cause had made his position unassailable. As his authority spread, so too did the reach of his religious message and the numbers of new Muslim converts. MUHAMMAD RECEIVES THE DIVINE REVELATION
The Battle of Uhud (in 625) was one 
of several bloody conflicts fought between the Muslims of Medina,  led by Muhammad, and the larger Qurayshi army from Mecca. 
Conquests beyond Arabia
Having secured their position, 
Muhammad’s successors, in particular Umar (634–44), initiated campaigns of conquest further afield. They were fortunate in that profound changes had occurred  on the northern fringes of Arabia. Between 602 and 628, the two long-established empires in the area— the Byzantines to the northwest and the Persian Sassanids to the northeast—had been engaged  in a long, vicious war that ended in catastrophe for both parties. Their coffers had been drained by the costs of the conflict and some regions within their territories had been utterly devastated. Both sides had also become reliant on Arabs to defend their borders and small, semi-independent Arab states had emerged on the peripheries of the two empires.
Rapid defeat
The Arab armies that swept northward in the 630s faced far less resistance than they would have half a century earlier. Provinces fell easily as weakened garrisons and the doubtful loyalty of citizens undermined resistance. Although relatively small in number and lightly armed, the Arab armies were very mobile and did not need to defend fixed positions, giving them a huge advantage over their opponents. When they defeated the Byzantines at Yarmuk in 636, the whole edifice of imperial control in Palestine and Syria came crashing down. In the case of Persia, it took Arab generals just nine years to dismember the Sassanid Empire. After Muhammad’s death, Islam entered a crisis and the fledgling religion might easily have been crushed. Tribes in the east broke away from the Muslim religious community (the umma ) and 
declared allegiance to their own prophet, while the Medinans were unhappy about the dominance of Meccans in the movement. The choice of Abu Bakr, Muhammad’s father-in-law, as caliph (successor) signaled that the leadership would remain in the Prophet’s family and this, together with a series of successful military campaigns against the malcontents, enabled the umma  to survive.

Islamic society
The newly conquered lands became part of an Islamic caliphate. Many  
of its inhabitants converted, while those who did not were tolerated  if they were Christians, Jews, or Zoroastrians, provided they paid a special tax. Islam transformed the lands it absorbed in many ways.  As well as sweeping away the old imperial structures, it imparted a new sense of religious community, often uniting the conquerors and the conquered. Islamic scholars resurrected the works of Greek philosophers and scientists that had languished forgotten for centuries, translating them into Arabic, and beautiful mosques began to adorn the towns. Areas that had been marginalized under the Byzantine or Sassanid Empires now found themselves at the heart of a new, vibrant civilization.
Success, however, brought its 
own problems for Islam. Acquiring lands far more urbanized than Arabia meant that the caliphs had to adapt from being warrior chiefs commanding a tight-knit group of followers, to monarchs ruling over a huge area with complex economies and societies. In addition to this, Muslims were initially in the minority, and not wholly united.
Growing divisions
Tensions over the succession to the caliphate resulted in a major schism in Islam. A struggle between Ali, Muhammad’s son-in-law, and Muawiya, the Governor of Syria,  led to a civil war that ended in  Ali’s murder and Muawiya taking control of the caliphate in 661. While Muawiya’s descendants  (the Umayyads) ruled from the Syrian city of Damascus, Ali’s followers opposed their authority, claiming the caliph should be chosen from among Ali’s offspring. After the murder of Ali’s son Husayn at Karbala in 680, the split between the Shia (those who supported  the right of Ali’s descendents to rule the caliphate) and the more THE MEDIEVAL WORLD
mainstream Sunni (who rejected this) became definitive—a division that continues to this day. 
Islamic unity was fractured in 
other ways too; ruling over such a vast empire was almost impossible when messages from the eastern and western extremities might take months to reach the caliph’s court. Independent Muslim dynasties emerged in peripheral areas and rival caliphs appeared in the 10th century in Spain, Tunisia, and Egypt. Yet even though its political unity had been shattered, and its religious unity compromised, Muhammad’s creed was so popular and successful that by the 21st century there were about 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide.

 THE CROWNING OF CHARLEMAGNE (800)
On Christmas Day, 800 an 
extraordinary event took place at St. Peter’s Basilica, 
Rome. Pope Leo III crowned the Frankish King Charlemagne with an imperial diadem, coronating the first emperor in the west for three centuries. The imperial crown established Charlemagne and his successors as secular rivals to the Papacy’s claim (as spiritual head of the church) to a position of authority over western rulers. In due course, Charlemagne’s empire (which later became known as the Holy Roman Empire) expanded to cover a vast area and laid the foundations for some of the future nation-states  of Western Europe.

provinces were invaded by barbarian 
tribes who established smaller kingdoms on its former territory. At first, the Eastern Roman emperors did not recognize the legitimacy of these new kings’ right to rule in nominally Roman territory. But as the new kingdoms, particularly that of the Franks, became stronger and more unified, Eastern Roman recognition ceased to matter. 
From kingdom to empire
Charlemagne, who came to the Frankish throne in 768, expanded his dominions extensively over time, conquering northern Italy  and Saxony, gaining some areas from the Arabs in northern Spain,  and taking Avar territories in the Danube. He strengthened Frankish administration, establishing a network of missi domenici —royal 
agents who would enforce his will in the provinces. For the first time  
in centuries, a powerful ruler controlled most of the former Western Roman Empire’s lands, turning them into a single political entity. By contrast, the Papacy had experienced difficult times in the 8th century, snared in petty power politics as various Roman noble families sought to secure positions in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. After Leo was assaulted in Rome  in 799, he fled across the Alps to seek help from Charlemagne, inviting him to bring order to  
Italy and restore the status of the church. A year later, Leo crowned Charlemagne, creating a Western emperor alongside the Eastern one.
Carolingian Renaissance
Charlemagne pushed forward his program of reforms, issuing an edict in 802 that required an oath of loyalty to be sworn and laying out the duties of his vassals. He also invited distinguished scholars to court, and encouraged academic disciplines that had languished since the collapse of the Roman Empire, including grammar, rhetoric, and astronomy. Music, literature, art, and architecture  also flourished during his reign. 
After Charlemagne’s death, 
divisions were rife. The Frankish custom of dividing the kingdom between several heirs weakened central authority and led to civil wars; it also allowed the emergence of powerful landowners, who often challenged royal authority. Ultimately, the empire split into  two main portions, which roughly equate to France and Germany today. The title of emperor was passed down to the immediate descendants of Charlemagne and then, from the 10th century, to  more distantly related German princes. In this form, as the Holy Roman Empire, it was to survive  to the early 19th century. 
■Charlemagne 
Charlemagne (c.747–814) was 
the eldest son of Pippin III, who in 751 deposed the last Merovingian king of the Franks and assumed the royal office himself. Energetic and visionary, Charlemagne greatly expanded the Frankish kingdom. He was also a very strong ruler, implementing reforms that enhanced the authority of the monarchy  
and the church. In addition,  
he reformed the kingdom’s economy by introducing  
a new monetary system, standardizing weights and measures, and unifying an array of different currencies  
to encourage commerce and trade. His acquisition of the imperial title in 800 further consolidated his power, but at first he made no plans to pass it on. His first decision on the succession, in 806, divided  
the realm between three of  
his sons but made no mention  
of the office of emperor. However, the deaths of two of his sons led Charlemagne to bequeath his lands and title to a single heir—Louis the Pious.He cultivated the  
liberal arts most studiously 
and, greatly respecting  
those who taught them,  
he granted them  
great honours.

After Leo was assaulted in Rome  in 799, he fled across the Alps to seek help from Charlemagne, inviting him to bring order to  
Italy and restore the status of the church. A year later, Leo crowned Charlemagne, creating a Western emperor alongside the Eastern one.
Carolingian Renaissance
Charlemagne pushed forward his program of reforms, issuing an edict in 802 that required an oath of loyalty to be sworn and laying out the duties of his vassals. He also invited distinguished scholars to court, and encouraged academic disciplines that had languished since the collapse of the Roman Empire, including grammar, rhetoric, and astronomy. Music, literature, art, and architecture  also flourished during his reign. 
After Charlemagne’s death, 
divisions were rife. The Frankish custom of dividing the kingdom between several heirs weakened central authority and led to civil wars; it also allowed the emergence of powerful landowners, who often challenged royal authority. Ultimately, the empire split into  two main portions, which roughly equate to France and Germany today. The title of emperor was passed down to the immediate descendants of Charlemagne and then, from the 10th century, to  more distantly related German princes. In this form, as the Holy Roman Empire, it was to survive  to the early 19th century. 
■Charlemagne 
Charlemagne (c.747–814) was 
the eldest son of Pippin III, who in 751 deposed the last Merovingian king of the Franks and assumed the royal office himself. Energetic and visionary, Charlemagne greatly expanded the Frankish kingdom. He was also a very strong ruler, implementing reforms that enhanced the authority of the monarchy  
and the church. In addition,  
he reformed the kingdom’s economy by introducing  
a new monetary system, standardizing weights and measures, and unifying an array of different currencies  
to encourage commerce and trade. His acquisition of the imperial title in 800 further consolidated his power, but at first he made no plans to pass it on. His first decision on the succession, in 806, divided  
the realm between three of  
his sons but made no mention  
of the office of emperor. However, the deaths of two of his sons led Charlemagne to bequeath his lands and title to a single heir—Louis the Pious.He cultivated the  
liberal arts most studiously 
and, greatly respecting  
those who taught them,  
he granted them  
great honours.

The seeds of rebellion
Under Xuanzong (712–56), the Tang 
dynasty reached the zenith of its power and prestige, yet several key economic, social, and political issues threatened to destabilize it. 
Firstly, the state was struggling 
to raise sufficient taxes to fund a sharp rise in military expenditure. The fu-bing , the cost-effective and 
self-supporting national militia system in which soldiers worked the land when not required for active military duty, was proving inadequate in the face of repeated invasions by neighboring groups. Xuanzong was forced to establish military provinces along China’s northern frontiers, headed by local governors who commanded huge armies, and who came to acquire considerable power and autonomy. 
The Tang’s coffers were drained 
further by the failure of the “equal field” system, a program of land distribution and tax collection that protected small farmers from the depredations of wealthy landowners by periodically reallocating land to them. Its gradual demise enabled the nobility to grab land to increase their regional power bases, and led to unrest among the peasantry.
 Lastly, earlier reforms made by 
Emperor Taizong (reigned 626–649) to the examination system used to recruit civil servants, which opened it up to able men from humbler backgrounds without connections, had created a bureaucracy based on merit that eroded the power  and influence of the aristocracy. Xuanzong now had to manage rival factions in his court—potentially rebellious nobles, ambitious professional bureaucrats, and military governors, some of whom had begun to intervene in politics.
However, it was a series of 
military debacles that provided the spark for revolt against the Tang, including the defeat by Abbasid Arabs in 751 that halted China’s expansion into Central Asia.
Turning on the Tang
Discontent exploded among the military, which saw its position threatened now that the era of conquest was over. An Lushan,  a prominent military governor who had become a court favorite, rose up against his masters. Claiming that the emperor had asked him to remove Yang Guozhong (the court’s chief minister, with whom An Lushan was engaged in an intense power struggle), he mobilized a rebel army and marched south.
At first the revolt looked set for 
success: it captured the eastern capital, Luoyang, early in 756—where An Lushan declared a rival dynasty, the Yan—before storming Chang’an, the primary capital. Xuanzong fled from his court, only just escaping An Lushan’s clutches. 
After eight years of war, the 
Tang finally crushed the revolt, but the effort had fatally weakened it. Over the next century it lost more political power to the military, and further rebellions broke out. By 907, the empire had fragmented into local dynasties and kingdoms that vied for power for 50 years.

The rise of the Abbasids
After the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632, his successors ruled over a growing Islamic empire (or caliphate). Following the murder in 744 of the caliph al-Walid, a member of the Umayyad family that had ruled from Damascus since 661, civil war broke out, ending only when the Abbasid dynasty came to power in 750. The Abbasids spent their first decade pacifying the empire, with the help of troops from Khurasan in northeastern Iran. These troops, a mixture of Arab-speakers, Persians, and central Asians, had been among the Abbasids’ principal backers and had provided them with a power base independent of the Arab tribes based in northern Arabia, Syria, and Iraq who had supported the Umayyads. 
It was in part to provide land  
for his Khurasani soldiers that al-Mansur, the second Abbasid caliph, established the city of Baghdad in 762. He chose the site for its mild climate and its location on the trade routes between Persia, Arabia, and the Mediterranean.  
It was also just 20 miles to the southeast of the Persian royal seat  
at Ctesiphon, which it soon eclipsed, enabling the new dynasty to portray themselves as masters of a culture that stretched back to Cyrus the THE FOUNDING OF BAGHDAD

also acted as an academy for 
scholars and a center for the translation of key scientific works into Arabic. Among its leading scholars were Hunayn ibn Ishaq (808–873), a Nestorian Christian from al-Hira in Iraq, who translated more than 100 mostly medical and philosophical works; and Thabit ibn Qurra, a member of a pagan sect known as the Sabaeans, who translated Elements , Euclid’s  
great work on geometry, and the Almagest , Ptolemy’s key work  
on astronomy.
Translation became a highly 
prestigious endeavor. One Arab patron paid an extravagant 2,000 dinars a month to ensure his association with a translation of  a work by the Greek physician Galen (a dinar, made of pure gold, weighed the same as 72 grains of barley). Within around 150 years, almost all of the key Greek texts that had been discovered had been rendered into Arabic. Many of them were not available in Western Europe at all, and even if they had been, knowledge of Greek had all but disappeared there. The Muslim world was therefore well set by around 850 to build on the scientific traditions of Classical and Hellenistic Greeks transmitted and developed under the Roman Empire—and to acquire a centuries-long lead over Christian Western Europeans.
Complex calculations
An understanding of mathematics and astronomy is essential to the calculation of the times at which Muslims must observe their five daily prayers (times that varied widely across the vast Islamic Empire), therefore both disciplines were studied assiduously. Another, separate, intellectual tradition contributed to the development  THE FOUNDING OF BAGHDAD

a decimal notation, which one of the members of the House of Wisdom, Al-Khwarizmi (c.780–830), adopted and described in The Book of Addition and Subtraction According to Hindu Calculation . 
Furthermore, Al-Khwarizmi also 
explained a method of calculating the square roots of numbers, and pioneered work on algebraic equations. He and his fellow scholars made rapid strides in geometry, taking as their starting point Euclid’s and Archimedes’s work on spheres and cylinders. 
Astronomy and medicine
Al-Khwarizmi compiled the first known tables of daily prayer times at Baghdad, his calculations assisted by direct astronomical observation. The early Islamic astronomers drew from Ptolemy’s Almagest , adopting his view that 
the Earth was at the center of the solar system, and that the planets rotated around it along the lines  
of eight spheres. They also learned from Hindu astronomers, translating and perfecting Indian zij , or tables of 
planetary positions, and continued to refine Ptolemy’s system, only occasionally (as in the work of the 10th-century astronomer al-Biruni) toying with a heliocentric system that had the sun at its center. Their calculations were made simpler when in the mid-eighth century they adopted the astrolabe, an instrument in which the celestial sphere was projected onto a flat plane marked with latitude and longitude lines. 
By the 13th century, Islamic 
astronomy was at its zenith, and  in 1259 a great observatory was constructed at Maragha in eastern Iran. Here Nasr al-Din al-Tusi  
and his successors made fine adjustments to account for slight discrepancies in the orbit of the planets, assisted by mechanical clocks that enabled them to record their observations in fine detail.Muslim scholars made advances in many other areas, too, first building on the base of Greek manuscripts translated into Arabic, and then making their own discoveries. They did not accept the theories of the ancients uncritically: al-Haythem (died 1039) produced a key work,  
the Book of Optics , in which he 
speculated that sight was the result of light traveling from an object to the eye, rather than the other way around as Ptolemy had theorized. Arab physicians continued to make progress, combining their practical THE MEDIEVAL WORLD
observations with theoretical analysis. Al-Razi (died 925) produced the first description of smallpox and measles, as well as compiling a medical compendium that began a tradition of such encyclopedias, culminating in  
the Canon of Medicine by ibn Sina (who was known as Avicenna in the West). Composed around 1015, it included separate sections for diseases that are specific to one body part, and those that afflict  the body as a whole.
Islamic science spreads 
The Islamic expansion that began in the mid-7th century not only absorbed ancient centers of learning such as Alexandria, but also brought the Muslim world to the fringes of Western Europe through the conquest of Spain (from 711) and Sicily (from 827).  
A tradition of Islamic learning embedded itself in both areas,  
and particularly in the Iberian Peninsula, known to the Arabs as al-Andalus. The court established there in 756 by Abd ar-Rahman I,

and his successors made fine adjustments to account for slight discrepancies in the orbit of the planets, assisted by mechanical clocks that enabled them to record their observations in fine detail.Muslim scholars made advances in many other areas, too, first building on the base of Greek manuscripts translated into Arabic, and then making their own discoveries. They did not accept the theories of the ancients uncritically: al-Haythem (died 1039) produced a key work,  
the Book of Optics , in which he 
speculated that sight was the result of light traveling from an object to the eye, rather than the other way around as Ptolemy had theorized. Arab physicians continued to make progress, combining their practical THE MEDIEVAL WORLD
observations with theoretical analysis. Al-Razi (died 925) produced the first description of smallpox and measles, as well as compiling a medical compendium that began a tradition of such encyclopedias, culminating in  
the Canon of Medicine by ibn Sina (who was known as Avicenna in the West). Composed around 1015, it included separate sections for diseases that are specific to one body part, and those that afflict  the body as a whole.
Islamic science spreads 
The Islamic expansion that began in the mid-7th century not only absorbed ancient centers of learning such as Alexandria, but also brought the Muslim world to the fringes of Western Europe through the conquest of Spain (from 711) and Sicily (from 827).  
A tradition of Islamic learning embedded itself in both areas,  
and particularly in the Iberian Peninsula, known to the Arabs as al-Andalus. The court established there in 756 by Abd ar-Rahman I,

Sina or Avicenna (980–1037) set the 
standard for medicine in the Islamic world and medieval Europe, and remained an authority for centuries.

a refugee Umayyad prince who had 
escaped the Abbasid revolution, became a magnet for scholars  
from the East, and its libraries became a repository of precious ancient texts that had been translated into Arabic. 
In 967, the French cleric and 
scholar Gerbert of Aurillac (who in 999 would become Pope Sylvester II) arrived in Spain for a three-year period of study at a monastery in Catalonia. There he had access  to manuscripts that had filtered over the border from Muslim-held al-Andalus. He took back to France knowledge of Arabic technology such as the water clock and the astrolabe, and of a type of abacus that used a decimal system.  
This was the first example of the system’s use in medieval Europe.  
It was a small beginning, and one paralleled in southern Italy where a medical school was established at Salerno in the 9th century. A few Islamic manuscripts reached the school in the early years, but many more arrived in the late 11th century when Muslim doctor Constantine the African returned from Qairawan in Tunisia. He had gone there to study medicine, and brought back with him works such as the Complete Art of Medicine by Ali ibn al-Abbas al-Majusi (known  
in the West as Haly Abbas), parts  
of which he then translated into Latin. This translation gave Western doctors and scholars access to comparatively advanced Muslim medical knowledge.THE FOUNDING OF BAGHDAD
Classical Greek texts arrived directly from the Byzantine Empire to the West (in particular Pisa, which had a trading quarter in Constantinople), including works  by the philosopher Aristotle. The main channel for the transmission  of Islamic learning into Europe, however, continued to be Spain. As Islamic Spain shrank, pressurized by the Reconquista, the flow of materials accelerated. The Christian reconquest spread increasingly into Muslim emirates until, in 1085, Alfonso VI of Castile captured Toledo. The city became a center  
for the translation of Arabic works by an international group including the Englishman Herbert of Ketton, Slav Hermann of Carinthia, the Frenchman Raymond of Marseilles, Jewish scholar Abraham ibn Ezra, and Italian Gerhard of Cremona.

translated many Arabic texts  
into Latin, including works on 
mathematics, medicine, and philosophy. Western Europe now had access to Ptolemy’s Almagest , 
and to the medical works of Galen, as well as access to new works by  Arabic writers who had built on  or summarized the work of their ancient predecessors, such as ibn Sina’s Canon of Medicine . This 
five-book encyclopedia became one of the most widely used treatises in European medical schools until the 16th century. 
Royal patronage 
This transmission of knowledge  
to the West mirrored the process  
by which the Islamic world had absorbed Greek learning during  
the great period of translation  
into Arabic in the 9th and 10th centuries. Noble and royal patrons played similar roles in both phases of the transmission. King Roger II  of Sicily (which by 1091 had been reconquered from the Muslims) invited Arab scholar al-Idrisi to his court in 1138 with a commission  
to construct a map of the world based on Islamic geographical  
and cartographic works. The result, which took more than 15 years to complete, was by far the most accurate world map yet available  to Europeans, and showed areas  as far east as Korea. The map  was accompanied by the Book of Pleasant Journeys into Faraway Lands , in which al-Idrisi’s royal 
patron could have read of wondrous things such as cannibals in Borneo, and the gold trade in Ghana.
A tradition of learning
Roger’s grandson Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor from 1220 until 1250, continued his grandfather’s tradition of sponsoring translations of Arabic texts. A remarkable polymath who knew at least four languages, Roger so impressed his contemporaries with his learning that he became known as Stupor Mundi (“the Marvel of the World”). Among his protégés were the Scottish scholar Michael Scot, who translated key works of Aristotle  on zoology, and the Pisan Leonardo Fibonacci, who had been sent  by his merchant family to study mathematics at Bougie in Muslim North Africa. There Fibonacci learned of the decimal system, and in 1202 he published the Book of Calculations , the most detailed 
account yet seen in Europe of the Arabic system of numbering.
By the early 13th century,  
the Abbasid Empire had all but collapsed. The difficulties of ruling such a far-flung empire and the effects of a series of civil wars had led to key provinces such as Spain, Tunisia, and Egypt breaking away to be ruled by their own caliphs. Even in Baghdad, where the Abbasid caliphs clung on, they were only notionally sovereign. Real power was held by other dynasties THE MEDIEVAL WORLD
such as the Shia Buyids, and, from 1055, the Seljuqs, a Turkish group originating in central Asia. The final blow was dealt by the Mongols, who surged westward into the Islamic world in the early 13th century.

The last ruling Abbasid caliph al-Musta’sim was executed, and political and cultural leadership of the Islamic world passed first to the Mamluks in Cairo and then, after their conquest of Egypt in 1517, to the Ottoman Turks.
By this time Europeans had 
rediscovered Greek and Roman learning in almost every field of scholarship through the medium of Arabic texts. It had taken centuries for the new material to be absorbed, and a further wave of interest in classical manuscripts in the 15th century to spark the Renaissance in Europe.

Anglo-Saxon Chronicle NEVER BEFORE  
HAS SUCH A TERROR 
 APPEARED IN BRITAIN
 THE VIKING RAID ON LINDISFARNE ( 793)
On a calm June day in 793,  
a party of men landed on the shore of the holy island 
of Lindisfarne in northern England, and mounted a ferocious attack  on its monastery. The invaders murdered some of the monks, dragged others away into slavery, and plundered the church’s treasures before slipping away.
This unexpected assault was 
the first recorded raid by Vikings—pagan seafaring warriors from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden—and news of it sent waves of horror and fear across Christian Europe. Over the next 200 years, Vikings would ravage and loot settlements across large parts of the continent. But they were also colonists and traders with a sophisticated artistic culture who left a lasting imprint on the places they invaded and settled.
An unstoppable force 
Within six years of the Lindisfarne raid, bands of Vikings—or “Danes” as they were known in Anglo-Saxon England—were targeting the wealth of other Christian sites in England, Scotland, Ireland, and France. Key to the success of these missions was the Viking longship, a slender vessel with a shallow bottom that enabled its crew to sail far up waterways and alight stealthily on shores. Each ship could carry up to 80 warriors, recruited by a warlord whose authority depended on his military prowess and his success in capturing booty for his followers.
No single motive drove the 
Vikings to venture across the sea. In parts of Scandinavia, population growth may have forced young men into a piratical lifestyle; in others, perhaps the increasing strength of local clan leaders sparked power struggles that pushed the losers into exile. And the newly rich trading towns in northern Europe

 THE ROMAN 
CHURCH HAS 
NEVER ERRED
 THE INVESTITURE CONTROVERSY (1078)
For three days in 1078, the 
Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV stood penitent, barefoot 
in the snow outside the Italian fortress of Canossa, begging Pope Gregory VII for absolution. This event was the culmination of the Investiture Controversy, a struggle between the two men about the extent of secular authority over the Christian church, and the authority to appoint—or invest—bishops. 
Both king and pope were rulers 
of particular domains, but they also had rival symbolic claims to lead all Christendom. An emperor had to be crowned by the pope before he assumed the imperial title. Pope Gregory VII asserted that the pope’s authority was supreme in spiritual matters, and that even in secular affairs it stood far above that of worldly princes. 
When at last Gregory signaled 
forgiveness of the penitent emperor, it marked a bitter blow for imperial prestige and a huge triumph for the independence of the church.

and monarchs were appointing 
their own bishops, especially in Germany where the office often came with considerable territorial domains. The feeling that the church had lost touch with its roots was also widespread: monasteries had become storehouses of treasure, bishops were ruling their lands like secular lords, and clerical offices were openly sold. Itinerant preachers started to inveigh against these betrayals, and calls for reform were beginning to be heard from within the church itself. Gregory vigorously promoted papal authority, and in 1075 a church council declared that only the  pope had the power to appoint bishops or move them to a different area. Henry, facing the loss  of authority over large tracts of Germany, continued to appoint bishops and called for the pope to step down. Gregory retaliated by excommunicating the king and declaring him deposed. German nobles, already feeling discontented at Henry’s attempts to centralize power, felt that this released them from their oath of loyalty, and many rose up in revolt. Caught between the papacy and the nobles, Henry eventually chose to take the road to Canossa in a humiliating retreat.

But Henry’s submission did not last. The issue of investiture was not explicitly settled and underlying dispute caused partisans of pope and emperor to clash repeatedly until 1122, when Henry’s son  Henry V agreed to the Concordat  of Worms. Squeezed between an increasingly assertive insistence on papal supremacy, and the growing independence of the German nobles, the emperor conceded virtually all investiture rights.

in 1098, had by 1153 nearly  350 houses, yet these enclosed orders did not fully answer the spiritual needs of a society that was becoming increasingly affluent, educated, and mobile.

became the military commander-in-chief, or shogun, it marked the ascent to power of a Japanese military class, the samurai, and established a line of military rulers who would govern Japan for the next 750 years.
The Japanese imperial court 
had been dominated since the  mid-7th century by regents from the Fujiwara family, who had reduced the emperors to mere figureheads. The situation became entrenched after the capital moved (following the emperor) to Kyoto in 794.  
Non-Fujiwara nobles were denied preferment at court, so sought positions in the provinces. The gulf widened between the Kyoto-based bureaucrats and the regional nobility, the samurai, who assumed 
At the time of the Gempei Wars the 
Samurai fought as mounted bowmen, but by the 15th century the sword, in particular the long-bladed katana , had 
become their principal weapon. IN CONTEXT

The Kyoto court appointed the most talented samurai as governors (zuryo ), both to bind them to the 
imperial government and to prevent them from building their own power bases. However, the samurai developed loyalty to their extended family, or clan, and its leader rather than to the emperor, and fought one another from their power bases in the provinces. The Minamoto and Taira clans engaged in a series of these struggles which culminated in the Gempei War, during which the Taira were utterly crushed.
The shogunate
Following his victory, clan leader Minamoto Yoritomo established  a parallel government based at Kamakura, about 250 miles east  of Kyoto. Other clan chieftains became his vassals or gokenin ,  
and he dispatched military estate governors to cement his control over the provinces. In 1192, Yoritomo accepted from the emperor the title of shogun, becoming the de facto military ruler of Japan. 
Over the following centuries, 
the emperors made periodic vain attempts to reassert authority over the shogunate, but the shoguns in turn could not maintain control of the samurai and their warlords, who controlled their areas and fought among themselves. Japan dissolved into a patchwork of military warlords or daimyo , each 
with its own power base and retinue of samurai warriors. 
Establishment of the office of 
shogun, which had seemed to offer Japan stability in 1192, ultimately led to the Sengoku, a civil war lasting almost 150 years. This war ended with the reunification of Japan under the new shogunate  of Tokugawa in 1603.

On June 15, 1215, King  
John of England signed  a charter at Runnymede,  
a meadow beside the Thames. Designed to make peace between the king and a group of rebel barons, the Magna Carta, as a form of the document became known, at first seemed ineffectual. However, its assertion of the rights of subjects against arbitrary actions of the Crown—the essential principle  
of the rule of law—provided a blueprint which, more than eight centuries later, is still viewed as a fundamental guarantee of rights  in the US and elsewhere. 
Feudal society
When King John acceded in 1199, England was a feudal society, a land-based hierarchy headed by the king, who owned all the land. The tenants-in-chief (or barons) received land from the king in exchange for loyalty and military service. They in turn leased the land to their own armed retainers, who leased to peasants, or villeins. Yet monarchs, especially in England, were levying an ever-increasing series of taxes and additional financial burdens on their barons. English kings from Henry I (1100–1135) onward also sought to centralize administration, partly by establishing a series of royal courts. These royal courts raised revenue for the Crown through fines and charges—but at the expense of the barons, who had previously raised those funds from their own local tribunals.
The exactions of King John
The barons’ discontent at these growing demands intensified under King John. Ruinously expensive campaigns against the French in 1200–04 had already resulted in the loss of Normandy (and earned the The Magna Carta included clauses 
relating to royal forests: the barons aimed to limit the king’s rights under England’s Forest Law, regulate forest boundaries, and investigate officials. IN CONTEXT

king the mocking nickname 
“Lackland”). Scutage, a further  
cash levy that left many barons in debt to money-lenders, was bitterly resented. Not only was the king proving lamentably unsuccessful  in war, but he had also broken the unspoken contract between himself and the barons, that allowed them to run their lands as they chose. 
Hoping for support from the 
pope, who had excommunicated John in 1209, the rebellious barons confronted the king. Attempts at diplomacy failed, and by May 1215, the barons had occupied London, forcing John to enter into a treaty with them to avoid a civil war. After careful direction of negotiations by Archbishop Stephen Langton of Canterbury, the agreement—more  
a truce than a peace—was signed.
Provisions of the charter
The charter was known as the Magna Carta, or Great Charter, to distinguish it from a more restricted Forest Charter issued in 1217. Much of the Magna Carta dealt with redressing baronial grievances,  as arrest or confiscation of land. The charter survived the civil war that broke out soon after the Magna Carta was agreed, and the papal repudiation of the charter’s terms  in August 1215, which led to the barons’ excommunication. Chapter 39 was extended under a 1354 law of Edward III to protect not only “free men” (a small minority in England where most people were technically serfs), but also any man “of whatever estate or condition  
he may be.” It survived longer  
than most of the other provisions, including the security clause that allowed barons to seize all the king’s land if he failed to fulfil his obligations under the agreement. 
What had seemed a small 
concession that day in Runnymede provided a long-lasting rallying cry for opponents of royal tyranny.
 ■ Influence of the Magna Carta
The Magna Carta has acquired 
an almost mythical status as  
the constitutional bedrock of subjects’ rights. It contributed to the development of parliament from the 13th century, and was used by 17th-century rebels to argue against the divine right  of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs Charles I and James II. Several American colonies’ charters contained clauses modeled on it, while  
the design of the Massachusetts seal chosen at the start of the Revolutionary War depicts a militiaman with sword in one hand and the Magna Carta in the other. Revolutionary feeling was fueled by Americans’  belief that the Crown had breached the fundamental law enjoyed by all English subjects, and both the United States Constitution, enacted in 1789, and the Bill of Rights adopted two years later, were influenced by the Magna Carta’s limitations on the arbitrary powers of a government against its subjects.but the section that has exerted  
the most influence down the ages was Chapter 39. This open-ended clause protected all “free men” from arbitrary actions by the Crown such Rights of individuals  
against arbitrary 
 punishment by the  
Crown are established.Financial demands  
to fund wars  
in France increase.Centralization

In March 1279, Mongol warriors 
swept through southern China, capturing the last strongholds 
of the Chinese Song dynasty. This defeat, which heralded the start  of the Yuan dynasty, marked the culmination of the Mongols’ rise  in under 70 years from an obscure nomadic group from the Central Asian steppes to the masters of a vast empire stretching from China to eastern Europe. One of the major challenges they now faced was to make the transition from roving tribesmen to settled conquerors. 
The rise of the Mongols
At the start of the 13th century,  the Mongols had consisted of many different warring clans. However,  
in 1206 Temüjin—later known as Genghis Khan—proclaimed himself the ruler of a united Mongol nation. Shrewd and ruthless, Genghis diverted his people from inter-clan warfare and directed their energies to the more lucrative business of invading—first neighboring tribes in the steppes, then more organized states such as Persia, Russia, and northern China (1219–23). He gave the Mongol hordes a proper military structure and exploited the skills they had learned from their nomadic lifestyle: as expert horsemen, the soldiers were masters of mobile warfare and able to descend with devastating force and lightning speed on their opponents.
The Mongols’ rule in China
Genghis’s grandson Kublai Khan ruled China from 1260, but the challenges of mediating between the nomadic traditions of the Mongols and the complex culture  of the conquered proved difficult. 
Paper money was invented by the 
Chinese c.800. By the Yuan dynasty, banknotes (such as the one above from 1287) were issued by the government. IN CONTEXT

The old informal hierarchies of  
the steppes no longer sufficed to administer a land that contained great cities, and the immediate rewards of plunder were replaced by the deferred benefits gained  by good governance and taxation. As a result, many Mongols missed the old ways. To appease his fellow Mongols, Kublai gave them greater rights and privileges than the native Chinese. Meanwhile, to gain favor with the traditional Chinese elites, he promoted Confucian scholars, funded Taoist temples, and had his son educated in Buddhist scripture. He also set up schools for peasants and introduced the Mongol postal system of using horses and relay stations to link up the empire, which benefited the merchants.
The end of the empire
The need to restore stability in northern China delayed Kublai’s attempts to subjugate the Song  in the south until 1268. Although ultimately successful, the 11-year campaign was ruinously costly.  To preserve their warrior identity, the Mongols needed the spoils of conquest to fund their huge army. Kublai’s successors failed to work out how to preserve their identity while also keeping their monopoly of power, and the Mongol military gradually declined. After decades of famine, lethal epidemics, and corruption at court, in 1368 the heirs of Kublai were defeated in  a rebellion led by Zhu Yuanzhang, founder of the Ming dynasty. After more than a century of occupation, China was back in the hands of the native (Han) Chinese.

gold, and horses traveling in  
the opposite direction. Chinese 
inventions ranging from gunpowder and paper to the magnetic compass were also brought to the west along the route, arriving at Constantinople and the Black Sea ports, the western end of the route where Genoa and Venice chiefly traded.
Mongol revival of the route
By the 13th century, empires that had controlled sections of the Silk Road had fragmented. This left  
the route less secure for travelers, and so deterred merchants from using it. However, following Mongol conquest of the area between 1205 and 1269, the area was controlled—if loosely—by a single authority, the Great Khan, so a merchant could travel from Khanbalik (Beijing) to Baghdad without leaving Mongol territory. This renewed stability encouraged a revival of trade.
At around this time, European 
merchants’ horizons were also expanding. In the early Middle Ages, traders could work only locally, and transport their goods to points where they might connect to longer-distance trade routes. From the  
12th century, Italian city States  
such as Pisa, Genoa, and Venice, pioneered maritime trade across the eastern Mediterranean, which enabled merchants to connect directly with sea routes that linked West Asia and Egypt to China via the Indian Ocean.
The profits for merchants taking 
advantage of the “Pax Mongolica,” or Mongol peace, could be huge.  In the late 13th century, the costs  
of setting up a caravan might amount to 3,500 florins, but the cargo, once sold in China, could yield seven times that sum, and  
by 1326 Genoese traders were a common sight in the principal Chinese port of Zaitun.  
Decline of land trade
The Silk Road flourished for another century, but the collapse of the Mongol Ilkhanate of Persia in 1335, and the overthrow in 1368 of the Yuan, the Mongol ruling dynasty  in China, once again left the route divided between politically weak powers. It was also blocked to European traders at the western end by the growth of the Muslim Ottoman Empire. 
A taste of the profits of long-
distance trade in luxury goods encouraged European powers  
to seek alternatives to the now defunct Silk Road, this time by  sea. In 1514, Portuguese merchants arrived off the coast of China, near Guangzhou, eager to take up the direct trading links with China that had been pioneered two and a half centuries earlier by their illustrious predecessor, Marco Polo. 
■Marco Polo
At just 17 years old, Marco 
Polo (1254–1324) set off from Venice to the court of the Mongol ruler, Kublai Khan.  
He traveled with his father and uncle, who had previously visited China and been entrusted by Kublai with a message for the pope. Polo was received with great favor at the Mongol court and stayed in China for 17 years. He traveled extensively throughout the country in the Khan’s service, leaving for home at last in around 1291. 
During a naval battle in 
1298, Polo was captured and imprisoned by the Genoese. The stories he told of his sojourn in the lands of the Great Khan attracted the attention of his cell mate, Rustichello, who wrote them down, embellishing them as he went along. The resulting book was translated into many languages and includes much invaluable information about late-13th-century  
China. After his release, Polo returned to Venice, where he lived for the rest of his life.

However, following Mongol conquest of the area between 1205 and 1269, the area was controlled—if loosely—by a single authority, the Great Khan, so a merchant could travel from Khanbalik (Beijing) to Baghdad without leaving Mongol territory. This renewed stability encouraged a revival of trade.
At around this time, European 
merchants’ horizons were also expanding. In the early Middle Ages, traders could work only locally, and transport their goods to points where they might connect to longer-distance trade routes. From the  
12th century, Italian city States  
such as Pisa, Genoa, and Venice, pioneered maritime trade across the eastern Mediterranean, which enabled merchants to connect directly with sea routes that linked West Asia and Egypt to China via the Indian Ocean.
The profits for merchants taking 
advantage of the “Pax Mongolica,” or Mongol peace, could be huge.  In the late 13th century, the costs  
of setting up a caravan might amount to 3,500 florins, but the cargo, once sold in China, could yield seven times that sum, and  
by 1326 Genoese traders were a common sight in the principal Chinese port of Zaitun.  
Decline of land trade
The Silk Road flourished for another century, but the collapse of the Mongol Ilkhanate of Persia in 1335, and the overthrow in 1368 of the Yuan, the Mongol ruling dynasty  in China, once again left the route divided between politically weak powers. It was also blocked to European traders at the western end by the growth of the Muslim Ottoman Empire. 
A taste of the profits of long-
distance trade in luxury goods encouraged European powers  
to seek alternatives to the now defunct Silk Road, this time by  sea. In 1514, Portuguese merchants arrived off the coast of China, near Guangzhou, eager to take up the direct trading links with China that had been pioneered two and a half centuries earlier by their illustrious predecessor, Marco Polo. 
■Marco Polo
At just 17 years old, Marco 
Polo (1254–1324) set off from Venice to the court of the Mongol ruler, Kublai Khan.  
He traveled with his father and uncle, who had previously visited China and been entrusted by Kublai with a message for the pope. Polo was received with great favor at the Mongol court and stayed in China for 17 years. He traveled extensively throughout the country in the Khan’s service, leaving for home at last in around 1291. 
During a naval battle in 
1298, Polo was captured and imprisoned by the Genoese. The stories he told of his sojourn in the lands of the Great Khan attracted the attention of his cell mate, Rustichello, who wrote them down, embellishing them as he went along. The resulting book was translated into many languages and includes much invaluable information about late-13th-century  
China. After his release, Polo returned to Venice, where he lived for the rest of his life.

 THE FALL OF JERUSALEM (1099)
On July 15, 1099, some 
15,000 Christian knights surged into Jerusalem 
after a month-long siege. The victorious crusaders slaughtered Muslim defenders and Jews alike  in a bloody act that marked the beginning of 200 years of Muslim–Christian warfare in the Holy Land.
Defending Christianity
Jerusalem had fallen into Muslim hands in 639. Neither the Byzantine emperors in Constantinople nor the Christian kings in Western Europe had the political willpower or the strength to reverse the conquest, although the city was sacred to both.In the 11th century, however, the advances of a new group, the Seljuk Turks, disrupted the pilgrimage routes to Jerusalem, and the  
Turks’ defeat of the Byzantines  at Manzikert threatened to push the frontiers of Christianity back  to the gates of Constantinople. In 1095, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos sent emissaries to Pope Urban II asking for help to bolster the Byzantine retaliation.Victorious crusaders flooded into 
Jerusalem, and in a ruthless assault seized the city from the Fatimid caliphate, laying the foundations  for a new kingdom.IN CONTEXT

The Just War
Pope Urban readily seized a cause 
that would enhance papal prestige. In a sermon of 1095, he described atrocities against Christians in the Holy Land, calling for an expedition to free them. Christian warriors rallied to the cause, eager to gain both salvation and plunder by joining a so-called Just War in God’s name. 
Some 100,000 crusading knights, 
mostly French and Norman, set out in 1096. Progress to Jerusalem was slow: the crusaders suffered several setbacks at the hands of the Seljuk Turks, and the long siege of Antioch severely tested their morale, yet they pressed on and, led by the French knight Godfrey of Bouillon, at last captured the Holy City. 
In the area they had conquered,  
the crusaders established four states, at Edessa, Antioch, Tripoli, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem, known collectively as Outremer.  To withstand the vigorous Muslim counter-attacks, the crusaders built a dense network of fortresses such as Beaufort, Margat, and Krak  
des Chevaliers, which dominated strategic routes into the Holy Land. As the initial crusading impulse waned, Outremer began to suffer from a shortage of manpower. This was partly resolved by the founding of crusading orders such as the Templars and Hospitaller knights, organizations who swore monastic vows to defend the Holy Land.

However, even this was not enough, and when Muslim armies captured Edessa in 1144, a Second Crusade was called. This, and the Emperor Alexios appeals

In the early 12th century, much  
of mainland Southeast Asia,  
including Cambodia, and parts 
of Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand, was 
controlled by the Khmer Empire from its capital at Angkor (in the northeast of present-day Cambodia)—an impressive urban complex with residential areas, temples, and a network of water reservoirs, built by a succession of god-kings who ruled as the earthly representatives of the Hindu god Shiva. 
Around 1120, the Khmer king 
Suryavarman II commissioned an ambitious new construction project—a 200-hectare (500-acre) temple complex dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu that would also record the king’s achievements. His spectacular Angkor Wat, completed 37 years later, was enclosed by a huge moat, adorned with lotus-shaped towers, and decorated with an 2,600ft-long (800m) gallery of fine bas-reliefs depicting scenes from Hindu mythology and the king as the embodiment of Vishnu.  
Angkor Wat is a testament to 
the remarkable productivity and creativity of one of the greatest powers in Southeast Asia’s history, yet its construction also marked  the onset of its decline, as later kings faced foreign invasions, shifts in trade, and wars with rival kingdoms that shrunk its territory. The empire’s fortunes were revived under Jayavarman VII, who made Mahyanana Buddhism the state religion, and initiated a building spree at Angkor, but his death in 1218 left it fatally weakened.

While the Khmer Empire held sway in mainland Southeast Asia, in

In the early 1400s, the empire contracted further as armies from Champa (now in Vietnam)  and Ayutthaya (now in Thailand)—seized more of its land. In 1431,  the latter took Angkor, and the capital was later relocated to the coast, leaving Suryavarman’s spiritual masterpiece to be reclaimed by the jungle.

Suryavarman was a warlike leader, waging campaigns in what is now Vietnam against the Dai-Viet between 1123 and 1136, and against the Khmer’s traditional enemy to the east, Champa, in 1145. He also pushed the empire’s boundaries deep into Thailand and made advances against the Pagan kingdom of Myanmar.

 MANSA MUSA’S HAJJ  TO MECCA (1324)
The Muslim West African 
kingdom of Mali burst  onto the world stage with  
a flourish in the early 14th century, when its fabulously wealthy ruler, Mansa Musa, made an unusually extravagant hajj  (pilgrimage) to 
Mecca, supported by the huge profits made by Mali’s control of the trans-Saharan caravan trade. The emperor’s year-long expedition became legendary in the Muslim world, and even in Europe, and  his subsequent promotion of Islamic culture and learning in  his kingdom was symbolic of the faith’s gradual infiltration of the trading empires of West Africa.

Under Mansa Musa (ruled 1312–37), Mali reached its greatest extent and power, having forged highly lucrative caravan connections with Egypt and other important trade centers in North Africa. Gold, salt, and slaves were taken north in exchange for textiles and manufactured goods.

his entourage—more than 60,000 people, including 500 slaves who bore staffs of pure gold—impressed his observers, and was a potent expression of his wealth. 
The expedition had a purpose 
beyond advertising Mali’s prestige however, as the king invited Muslim scholars and a great architect, Abu Ishaq al-Sahili, to make the return journey with him. The latter built West Africa’s first mud-brick mosques at Timbuktu and Gao, trading posts recently captured from the neighboring Songhai. Under Mansa Musa’s guidance, Timbuktu became Mali’s main commercial hub—boosted by its advantageous location at the junction of the desert trade and the maritime routes down the Niger—and began its rise as the region’s intellectual and spiritual capital.  A teaching center grew around al-Sahili’s Sankore mosque, laying the foundations for the celebrated Sankore University and other madrasas  (Islamic schools). 
After Mansa Musa’s death, Mali 
initially thrived under his son, but thereafter, weak rulers, external aggression, and the need to keep rebellious tribes in check sapped its strength until it was eclipsed by the Songhai Empire of Gao: by 1550 it was no longer a major political entity. Mansa Musa’s great empire—one of the most prosperous states in  the 14th century—may have been short-lived, but his celebrated hajj  
had longer-lasting effects, helping to spearhead the spread of Islamic civilization in West Africa.

Costa Rica. This progress was paralleled by the growth at much the same time of Cuzco, the capital of the Incas—an Andean people of humble beginnings, who in just a few decades created the largest state South America had yet seen.
Aztec foundations
The Aztecs may have begun their wanderings in northern Mexico around 1200. For the next 100 years they eked out a miserable existence as mercenaries or barely tolerated squatters, their plight not aided by their reputation as cruel warriors. Frequently, they had to flee after committing violent acts, at times involving human sacrifice; indeed, their flight to Tenochtitlan was prompted by one such incident. The Aztecs had asked their host, the lord of Culhuacán, whether he would give his daughter as a bride for their chief. He agreed, believing she would be greatly honored as queen; however, to his horror they killed and flayed her as a sacrifice to their deity Xipe Totec. Driven out by the lord and his soldiers, the Aztecs fled southward toward the future site of Tenochtitlan.  
Although the soil around Lake 
Texcoco, on which the island of Tenochtitlan was situated, was marshy and there was very little timber available, the capital was easily defensible and the Aztecs used it to consolidate their position. Initially shielded by a treaty with the Tepanec ruler Tezozomoc, who dominated the Valley of Mexico from 1371 to 1426, the Aztecs went on to form a Triple Alliance with the cities of Texcoco and Tlacopan in 1428—a union that kick-started a period of imperial expansion.

In 1325, a band of Central 
American refugee warriors, known as the Aztecs, saw a 
sign their patron god Huitzilopochtli had long ago prophesied—an eagle perched on a cactus, marking the spot they had been told to settle. Before long, they had built a temple that became the nucleus of their capital, Tenochtitlan. Within two centuries, the city was the center  of the most predominant empire in  the history of Mesoamerica—a large region that shared a pre-Columbian culture and extended from modern-day central Mexico southward to Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador,

Under Itzcoatl (1427–40), Moctezuma I (1440–69), Axayactl (1469–81), and Ahuitzotl (1486–1503) Aztec armies subdued their neighbors in the Valley of Mexico and then spread outward, reaching Oaxaca, Veracruz, and to the edges of land controlled by the Mayan people in the east of modern-day Mexico and Guatemala. 
As the Aztec Empire expanded, 
society was transformed. A warrior elite emerged, while at the bottom of society bondsmen ( mayeques ), 
who owned no land, were bound  by labor service to their lords. The militaristic nature of Aztec society was accentuated by an education system in which all males received military training (in separate schools for nobles and commoners). This reinforced the warrior ethos and gave the Aztecs an incalculable advantage over neighboring tribes in Mexico.
The imperial system
Tenochtitlan was adorned by many temples to the gods of the Aztec pantheon. Each god had their own temple, with the Templo Mayor having twin shrines dedicated to Huitzilopochtli and Tlaloc, the rain god. At these temples a stream of human victims was sacrificed—up to 80,000 at the rededication of the Templo Mayor in 1487—by burning alive, decapitation, or cutting open the chest and removing the heart.
Many of the Aztec battles were 
“flower wars”: ritual affairs in which opponents were captured (rather than killed) and sacrificed to placate the Aztec gods, who were believed to need blood to sustain them and keep the sun moving across the sky. Tenochtitlan also exacted tribute from its subjects. Although there was very little in the way of an organized government bureaucracy, there were tax collectors, who criss-crossed the 38 provinces of the Aztec Empire and levied tribute, which included 7,000 tons of maize, 4,000 tons of beans, and hundreds of thousands of cotton blankets

each year. The empire depended on 
this tribute to reward the nobility and the warriors, who ensured that the towns subjugated by the Aztecs remained submissive—little mercy being shown to those who revolted. 
While the Aztecs provided some 
security to their subjects, they gave little else. At Tenochtitlan, artificial islands ( chinampas ) were created at 
great expense to expand the land available to produce food, but no such works were carried out for the subject cities. Defeated states did not provide troops for the Aztec army, and so did not share in the spoils of future victory, and little effort was made to propagate the Aztec language. It was an empire built on fear and in the end it proved brittle: when it was invaded by a small party of Spaniards led by Cortes in 1519, the subject peoples rallied to the newcomers rather than defending the Aztecs, and the empire collapsed within two years.
Inca beginnings
The Incas, whose heartland lay high in the central Andes around Cuzco, in modern-day Peru, had similarly humble origins to the Aztecs, but their rise to imperial status was, if anything, even more meteoric. They began as a small, somewhat disregarded tribe and developed their own strategies  to co-opt neighboring groups  into a successful empire. 
The Incas’ origin myth told of 
their emergence from a cave in the high mountains, from where their first leader—Manco Capac—led  his people to Cuzco. It is generally believed that the Incas arrived in the region around 1200, and for two centuries they remained a relatively THE FOUNDATION OF TENOCHTITLAN
insignificant farming group, with their society divided up into clans (ayllus ) of roughly equal status. 
Inca expansion
The Incas began to make their mark as a major power around 1438, when the neighboring Chanca people attempted to push the Incas out of the Cuzco valley. By this time, the Incas had a supreme leader  (the Sapa Inca), and although the incumbent Viracocha was unequal to the task, his son Pachacuti defeated the invaders, and then led Inca armies to conquer the rest of the Cuzco valley and the southern highlands around Lake Titicaca. Under Pachacuti’s son Topa Inca Yupanqui and grandson Huayna Capac, the Incas overcame Chimor (the largest coastal state) in about 1470. They then absorbed the rest of the northern highlands and extended to parts of modern-day Ecuador and Colombia and south  to the deserts north of Chile. 
Unlike the Aztecs, the Incas 
recruited troops from among the conquered peoples (placed under the command of Inca officers), thus providing them with the lure of plunder in return for their loyalty.
Inca communication
The empire of the Incas was highly centralized; censuses recorded the number of peasants, who all owed labor service ( mitad ) to the Sapa 
Inca. This level of organization enabled the construction of public works on a vast scale. Particularly vital was the extensive road network, which extended nearly 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers) long and was dotted at regular intervals with resthouses that facilitated rapid transit for the  army and provided a very efficient system of communication across the far-flung Inca domains. At the If the land [Peru] had not been

Tlacaelel 
As the Aztec Empire expanded 
and conquered new territories, it became increasingly necessary to create a more complex system of administration. After Itzcoatl became ruler ( tlatoani ) in 1427, 
he introduced the new post of chief adviser ( cihuacoatl ). The 
office’s first incumbent was Itzcoatl’s nephew, Tlacaelel (1397–1487), who held the office until his death. Tlacaelel served through several reigns and he provided invaluable continuity. In addition, he created impetus for his reforms (mostly benefiting the royal family and nobles) by ordering the destruction of earlier chronicles and the rewriting of Aztec history to establish the basis of Aztec imperial ideology.
He also presided over the 
formation of the Triple Alliance, solidifying the Aztec position and ensuring a steady stream  
of sacrificial victims. Given that Tlacaelel was never the Aztec’s ruler, his immense influence in Tenochtitlan shows that the Aztec system of authority was not as monolithic as it might  
at first appear.

same time, the Inca domestication 
of the llama as a beast of burden made it easier to transport heavy loads across the empire. 
Unlike the Aztecs, the Incas 
actively sought to spread their own language (Quechua) and system of religious beliefs, which was initially based around the worship of Inti (the sun god), but which came to feature prominently Viracocha—a supreme creation god and therefore considered a more suitable deity for a conquering power. They also dispatched colonists ( miqmaq), 
shifting troublesome groups into more pacified areas to dilute their resistance and creating networks  of loyal settlers on the fringes of  the empire. Although definitive population statistics are not known, by the early 16th century the Inca Empire—which the Incas called Tawintusuyu ( “The Realm of Four Quarters”)—consisted of about 4–6 million people in total, operating to the advantage of the Inca minority and their subjects. 
Despite its many strengths,  
the highly centralized nature of  the Inca Empire proved fatal in the early 1530s, when Spanish invaders led by Pizarro captured the Sapa Inca Atahuallpa; without their leader, the Incas rapidly collapsed.
The new colonizers

releasing a large proportion of their population to fight in the armies that conducted their campaigns of expansion. They also reorganized the traditional tribal structure to favor a warrior and noble elite.  In both cases, the momentum of conquest demanded further wars  to reward the warrior caste or to provide an incentive for newly conquered peoples to remain loyal and thus to gain the rewards of participation in new campaigns.
Neither the Aztecs nor the Incas 
survived long enough to govern after their expansion slowed down. Had they done so, they might have developed strategies to bring long-term stability to their empires, or might have declined to the status  of competing city-states fighting to control limited resources. Instead, the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs in 1521 and their defeat of the last Incas by 1572 put paid to the ambitions of both empires and left the Spanish firmly established as colonial rulers in the region for the next 300 years.

 THE OUTBREAK OF THE BLACK DEATH  
IN EUROPE (1347)
In late November 1347, a galley 
entered the Italian port of Genoa, having fled a Tatar 
siege of Kaffa in the Crimea. It bore a deadly cargo: the bubonic plague. Within a mere two years, this lethal pestilence had killed more than a third of the population of Europe and the Middle East, and altered the regions’ economic, social, and religious makeup forever.
Spread of the Black Death
Having probably originated in Central Asia or western China  in the 1330s, the plague’s initial progress westward was slow,  but after it reached Crimea and Constantinople in 1347 it spread rapidly along maritime trade routes. Having hit Genoa, it appeared quickly in Sicily and Marseilles; by 1348 it had struck Spain, Portugal, and England, and it reached Germany and Scandinavia by 1349. 
The epidemic’s main vector was 
infected fleas and the rats that harbored them, both of which flourished in the unsanitary conditions of the time. The main symptoms of the disease were swellings, known as buboes, that appeared in the groin, neck, or armpits. These were followed by black blotches on the skin (hence “Black Death”) and then, in around three-quarters of cases, by death.
Contemporaries ascribed the 
causes of the pestilence variously to divine punishment for immorality, adverse conjunctions of the planets, earthquakes, or bad vapors. There was no cure, but preventive advice included abstinence from hard-to-digest food, the use of aromatic herbs to purify the air, and—the only effective measure—avoiding the company of others.

people may have died of the plague; estimates put the world population

at 450 million before it arrived, and

ousted the despised Yuan dynasty—

Zhu reigned as emperor Hongwu (“Vastly Martial”—a reference to  his military prowess) from 1368 until his death in 1398, by which time he had firmly established one of China’s most influential, but also  most authoritarian, dynasties. He and his successors brought three centuries of prosperity and stability to the country, establishing its government and bureaucracy in a form that would endure, with slight modifications, until the demise  of the imperial system in 1911, and broadening the base of its economy.

Zhu’s new dynasty arose from  the chaos that accompanied the decline of the Yuan. In the 1340s and 50s, factionalism in the Mongol court, rampant government corruption, and a series of natural disasters, including plagues and epidemics, resulted in wholesale breakdown in law and order and administration as peasant groups rose up against their faltering HONGWU FOUNDS THE MING DYNASTY

The rest of the country was then subdued, although the Mongols resisted in the far north until the early 1370s, and the unification of China was not achieved until the defeat of the last Mongol forces in the south in 1382.
Reform and despotism 
Zhu’s first priority as emperor Hongwu was to establish order—decades of conflict had ravaged China and impoverished its rural population. His humble beginnings may have influenced some of his early policies: responsibility for tax assessment was entrusted to rural communities, sweeping away the problem of rapacious tax collectors who had preyed on poorer areas; slavery was abolished; many large estates were confiscated; and lands owned by the state in the under-populated north of the country were handed to landless peasants, to encourage them to settle there. 
From 1380, Hongwu instituted 
government reforms that gave him personal control over all matters of state. After executing his prime minister, who had been implicated in a plot to overthrow him, he abolished the prime ministership and the central secretariat and  had the heads of the next layer of government, the six ministeries,  report directly to him, ensuring he oversaw even minor decisions. 
From then on, Hongwu acted  
as his own prime minister. His workload was almost unbearable—in a single week-long stint, he  had to scrutinize and approve  some 1,600 documents—and as  a result, the state became incapable of responding swiftly to crises. Although in time a new

grand secretariat emerged—an 
advisory board through which  the emperor responded to the six ministries and other government agencies—the Ming retained  a more autocratic and highly centralized structure than that of previous Chinese dynasties. This was reflected in the protocol of the Ming court, too: under the Song dynasty (960–1279), the emperor’s advisers had stood before him to discuss matters of state, but under the Ming they were required to kowtow —kneel and knock their 
heads to the floor—before him, a reverential acknowledgment of his absolute power and superiority.
Curbing the military
In the later years of the Yuan dynasty, the state had been torn apart by competing power bases outside the central court, and in a bid to avoid this scenario, Hongwu diluted the strength of the army. Although he adopted the Yuan military system—establishing garrisons in key cities, particularly along the northern frontier, where the threat of nomad incursions  was ever-present, and creating a hereditary caste of soldiers that supported itself on land granted  by the government—he also ensured that military units were periodically rotated through the capital for training, and that a group of centrally selected officers shared authority in the army with the garrison commanders, thus preventing the rise of influential warlords with a strong local base. 
Perfecting the civil service
Hongwu also had a deep mistrust  of the elite scholar class that had been at the heart of government for centuries. However, he was aware that they played a vital role in the efficient running of the state, and The Forbidden City —the imperial palace  
in Beijing—adhered to hierarchic Confucian 
ideology: the higher one’s social status, the further one could enter into the city. 
1 Meridian Gate The grand entrance 
had five gates. The central one was always reserved for the emperor.
2 The Golden Water Bridge 
Crossing points like the bridges were arranged in odd numbers. Only the emperor could use the central passage, with the next highest rank able to use the neighbouring paths.3 Outer Court This area was reserved for state affairs and ceremonial purposes. 
4 Inner Court Only the emperor and 
his family could enter the Inner Court.
5 The Palace of Heavenly Purity  
To fool assassins, the palace had nine bedrooms: the emperor slept in a different one each night. 5

so he promoted education and 
trained scholars specifically for the bureaucracy. In 1373, he suspended the traditional examinations used to recruit civil servants and ordered the establishment of local county and prefectural schools. From  these, the best candidates would be called for further study at a national university in the capital, where eventually 10,000 students from the original intake were enrolled. The civil service examinations were restored in 1385, when the emperor considered the well-trained graduates of the university ready to take them, and were so competitive that soldiers were stationed outside the cubicles where the examinees sat to avoid any collaboration or illicit use of reference materials. 
The pool of potential recruits 
into the administration was thus widened, but civil servants still received a very conservative education based on the Four Books and Five Classics of Confucianism and a selection of neo-Confucian works that expounded the virtues of loyalty to the emperor and adherence to Chinese tradition. Innovation was discouraged and bureaucrats became set in their ways. Those who were perceived  as having stepped outside their brief were publicly flogged, sometimes to death. 
This maltreatment of public 
servants was a sign of the cruel side of Hongwu’s personality. He was also violently paranoid, and vicious in his suppression of dissent. In 1382, he established  a secret police, the Embroidered Brocade Guard, whose 16,000 officers stamped out all signs of resistance. The Guard’s reach and

China’s domination over the area 
by exacting tribute and other gestures of homage to the emperor. 
The later Ming
However, the enormous cost of Zheng He’s ambitious ventures put great strain on the treasury, and  to ensure they would never be repeated, all records relating to them were destroyed. Official ideology regarded China as the center of the world, and the later Ming saw no reason to encourage further maritime contact. The Chinese did not regard relations with foreign powers as possible on an equal basis: where diplomatic relations were conducted, the foreigners were considered (by the Ming, at least) as tributaries. The confidence and stability of the Ming bureaucracy also created a sense of self-sufficiency, with little use for external influences.
Ocean-going vessels were made 
to report all the cargo they landed, and private maritime trade was periodically banned (until it was legalized again in 1567 for all except trade with Japan). In Beijing, a shopkeeper’s unauthorized contact with foreigners could result in the confiscation of his stock.Diplomatic isolation was reinforced by military uncertainty: Annam became independent once more in 1428, while huge resources were devoted to containing the threat posed by the Mongol tribes on China’s northern borders. In 1449, Emperor Zhengtong personally led a disastrous expedition against the Mongol leader Esen Khan in which the majority of the 500,000 Chinese soldiers died of hunger, were picked off by the enemy, or perished in a final battle as they retreated. 
Extending the Great Wall
In the 1470s, the building of the final stages of the Great Wall—begun by the Qin dynasty in the 3rd century 
bce—was not only a  
bid to prevent a similar disaster, but also to compensate for the Ming’s waning energy. Like their predecessors, they were unable to absorb the lands of the nomadic groups to the north of the border,  or to send out expeditions that had any lasting effect on discouraging their raids. Therefore, a fixed, strongly garrisoned border defense was the best compromise.

consorts, mothers, or by eunuch 
(castrated) advisers, was capped by the long reign of Wanli (1573–1620), who simply withdrew from public life entirely: for the last decades of his reign, he refused even to meet with his ministers. The dynasty began to decline: the machinery of government faltered and the army had little strength to respond to the serious threat posed by the Jurchen in Manchuria (now in northeast China). In 1619, this tribal people, who later renamed themselves Manchu, began to encroach on China’s northern borders.
Global trade
Economically, however, Ming China’s great productivity was  a magnet for European maritime states seeking new commercial connections in East Asia, and in the early 16th century, European traders finally reached the coast of China. In 1514, a Portuguese fleet 
US_120-127_Hongwu_founds_Ming.indd   126 15/02/2016   16:41127
appeared off Canton (now Guangzhou) in the south, and by 1557, Portugal had established a permanent base at Macao. Spanish and Portuguese merchants (the former operating from Nagasaki  in Japan and Manila in the Philippines)—and from 1601, the Dutch—secured an important share in trade with China.
Even though Ming policy 
discouraged foreign maritime trade, individual Chinese merchants had participated actively in the revived economy. Before long there were flourishing Chinese colonies in Manila and on Java in Indonesia, near the Dutch-controlled trading city of Batavia, and Chinese merchants controlled a large share of local trade in Southeast Asia. The technical sophistication of the Chinese porcelain industry under the Ming led for the first time to the mass production of ceramics for export to European markets.
The effects, though, of this 
growth in trade were not wholly positive: while a huge influx of silver from the Americas and Japan, used by the Europeans to pay for Chinese goods such as  silk, lacquerware, and porcelain, stimulated economic growth, it  also caused inflation.
Technological change
Ming China had inherited a legacy of scientific and technological innovation from the Song dynasty, which had left the country at the forefront of many scientific fields, including navigation and the military applications of gunpowder— a substance discovered during the Tang era whose use had spread  
to Europe from China in the 13th century. Under the Ming, though,  
the pace of progress slowed and by the later part of the dynasty, ideas had begun to flow in from Europe. The Chinese military began to use artillery of European manufacture, and knowledge of European mathematics and astronomy was introduced to the country through Jesuit missionaries, including Matteo Ricci, who lived in Beijing from 1601 to 1610. He translated  the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid’s Geometry  into Chinese, as 
well as a treatise on the astrolabe (an astronomical instrument used for taking the altitude of the sun or stars). In 1626, the German Jesuit Johann Adam Schall von Bell wrote the first treatise in Chinese on the telescope, bringing Heliocentrism (an astronomical model in which  
the sun lies at the center of the universe) to a Chinese audience.
The Ming collapse
The late Ming began to suffer many of the same issues that had led to the fall of the Yuan. Crop failures reduced the productivity of China’s vast agriculture, and famines and floods led to widespread unrest in rural areas. The army’s pay began to fall into arrears, leading to discipline problems and desertions, while localized peasant uprisings THE MEDIEVAL WORLD
coalesced into more general revolts.  Meanwhile, on the northeastern frontier, the Manchus had built  a state along Chinese lines at Mukden in Manchuria—calling their regime the Qing dynasty in 1636—and were now poised to take advantage of the Ming’s imminent collapse. They were aided in this by a revolt led by Li Zicheng, a rebel leader whose forces entered Beijing in 1644 unopposed, prompting the emperor to commit suicide. In desperation, the Ming military called on the Manchus for help. The tribesmen swept into the capital and drove out the rebels, but then seized the throne, and proclaimed the Qing dynasty in China. 
An enduring legacy
Although the Ming had fallen victim to an agrarian crisis that coincided with renewed nomadic activity on its frontiers, this was  a combination that had also brought down dynasties before it. The bureaucracy that had given China centuries of constancy and reduced the possibility, or even the need, for internal dissent, was slow to adapt itself to times of fast-moving crisis. 
Yet even so, the Ming era had 
brought great wealth and success to China. The population expanded from around 60 million at the start of its rule, to around three times  that number by 1600. Much of this growth was centered in medium-sized market towns, rather than  in large cities, and an increase in agricultural production led to the rise of an affluent merchant class in the provinces. Many of the elements of orderly government that Hongwu had inaugurated were carried over into the succeeding Qing dynasty, providing China with a degree of unity, stability, and prosperity that the European states of that period could only envy and admire.

CAST DOWN THE 
ADVERSARIES OF MY 
CHRISTIAN PEOPLE
 THE FALL OF GRANADA (1492)
At midnight on January 2, 
1492, Abu ‘Abd Allah, the Muslim Emir of Granada, 
handed over the keys of his city to King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, joint rulers of the Christian Spanish states of Aragón and Castile. This act marked the end of nearly 800 years of Muslim rule in the Iberian peninsula and the eclipse of a  great civilization renowned for its architectural splendors and a rich tradition of scholarship. At the same time, it signaled the birth of a self-confident, united Spain that would soon divert its energies away from crusading against its Muslim neighbors, turning them instead towards building an overseas empire in the New World. 
Christian conquests
Muslim Spain (or al-Andalus)  dated from the Islamic conquest  of the Visigothic kingdom in 711. Christian resistance survived in Asturias, in the far north, but it  took centuries for the kingdoms of Castile, Aragón, León, and Navarre to gain the strength to push slowly southward into Muslim lands.  This gradual reconquest, known  as the Reconquista, gathered pace during the 11th century, when  the Muslim regions broke up into numerous competing emirates (“taifas ”) and lost the strategically 
important city of Toledo in central Spain, in 1085. 
The growth of the crusading 
spirit in western Europe also accelerated the progress of the Reconquista. Formal crusades against the Spanish Muslims (or Moors) were declared several times from the mid-14th century and a military culture emerged, in which raids into al-Andalus acquired the air of righteous expeditions.

 KING SEJONG INTRODUCES A NEW SCRIPT (1443)
In 1443, the Korean court of 
King Sejong announced the creation of Han’gul, a national 
alphabet for the Korean language, and launched a program of publications in the new script. The measure was one of a number of strategies encouraged by Korea’s king that were designed to stabilize Korea and improve prosperity, and enabled his Choson (or Yi) dynasty to survive for another 450 years.
Rise of the Yi dynasty
The Mongol Yuan dynasty had controlled the Korean Peninsula from the late 11th century until 1368, when it was overthrown by the Ming dynasty. Korea was left  in chaos as its Koryo kings tried  to reverse the effects of a century’s authoritarian domination. The redistribution of land and the sacking of pro-Mongol ministers led almost to civil war, but in 1392 Sejong’s grandfather Yi Songyye, a former general, stepped in, deposed the last Koryo king, and assumed the throne as King T’aejo. 
King T’aejo’s immediate priority 
was to secure stability, and the installation of a state ideology based on neo-Confucianism was key to achieving that. This ideology sought to re-establish proper relations between the ruler and his people, and conferred privileged status on a bureaucratic class that would act as guardian of the social hierarchy. Buddhism had been the dominant ideology under the Koryo dynasty, but T’aejo undermined its hold in the region by breaking up large estates controlled by Buddhist temples and redistributing the land, some to Confucian shrines. 
King Sejong of Choson , also known 
as Sejong the Great, revolutionized 
government by making it possible for people other than the social elite to become civil servants. IN CONTEXT

Neo-Confucianism emphasised  
the importance of education as a way of producing a class of literati capable of ensuring the harmonious running of the state. T’aejo's grandson, King Sejong (reigned 1418–1450) raised this principle to new heights, founding in 1420 the Chiphyon-jon (Hall of Worthies), an elite group of 20 scholars tasked with research that would promote the better running of the kingdom.
Encouragement of wider literacy 
was an important neo-Confucian ideal, and T’aejo had already ordered the foundation of government-sponsored schools. At the time, however, Korean was written in Chinese characters, which were  not well adapted to express the sounds of the language. Sejong himself is said to have developed the simplified script, the Han’gul, whose principles were explained  in Proper Sounds for the Education of the People , a book published in 
1445. Having only 28 characters—later reduced to 24—the script  was far easier than Chinese was  to learn, but its introduction faced bitter resistance from traditionalist nobles. They feared it might open civil service examinations to people from other social classes, which would risk diluting their power. As  a result Han’gul faded from use, relegated as the “vulgar letters”  of the lower orders, until its rediscovery in the 19th century, since when it has thrived as a vehicle for Korean nationalism.
The reforms of T’aejo and 
Sejong, however, broadly survived, creating a class of yangban—elite government officials dedicated to the perpetuation of the state. The yangban also acted as a break on any tendency to autocracy among the Yi monarchs, which helped  the resulting dynasty to endure for more than five centuries.

The neo-Confucianism that 
became dominant in Korea under the Choson dynasty had evolved in China during the 11th and 12th centuries as a means to revive Confucianism, which had declined in favor of Taoism and Buddhism under the Tang and early Song.  
A more rationalist and secular form of Confucianism, the new philosophy rejected superstitious and mystical elements that had influenced Confucianism during and after the Han dynasty. Writers such as Confucian scholar Zhu Xi stressed the importance of morality, respect for social harmony, and education as means of understanding the Supreme Ultimate (
tai qi ), the 
underlying principle of the universe. In practice, however, neo-Confucian virtues such  
as loyalty, determination, and the belief that a supreme monarch should rule the state  
to parallel the Supreme Ultimate that governed the universe, tended to favor a hierarchical, bureaucratic state staffed  
by scholars who jealously maintained the status quo.

THE ARAB ADVANCE IS 
HALTED AT TOURS 
(732)
By the 8th century, the Islamic 
people of the Arabian peninsula had conquered much of North Africa and crossed into Europe, occupying Spain and moving into southern France. Their northward expansion seemed unstoppable—until 732, when they met combined Frankish and Burgundian troops at Tours. The Franks and Burgundians won the battle, and the Arab leader, Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi, was killed. Although there was another invasion in 735–39, the Arabs  never got further than Tours.  The Franks kept their power in Western Europe, Christianity was preserved as the continent’s dominant faith, and only Spain remained under Muslim rule.
ALFRED RULES WESSEX
(871–99)
Alfred was an able ruler and military leader who successfully defended his kingdom from Danish invaders. He expanded his territory from his base in Wessex (central southern England), uniting a large part of southern England under him. He built fortifications, founded a navy, encouraged education, and promoted Old English as a literary language via translations of Latin books. Alfred became known as “King of the English” and, although the Danes still held the northeast, is seen as the monarch who first his rule into northern Italy, creating what became the Holy Roman Empire. This major political power—whose emperors claimed to be the secular leaders of Christian Europe, vying with the Popes for power—dominated much of Europe for more than 900 years.
THE GREAT SCHISM
(1054)
During the late centuries of the  1st millennium 
ce, the Eastern  
and Western parts of the Christian church had several disagreements about authority (with the pope claiming seniority over the Eastern patriarchs, but the latter disputing this), the wording of the Creed,  and liturgical matters. These disputes came to a head in 1054, when Pope Leo IX and Patriarch Michael I excommunicated one another, creating a split called  the Great Schism. This division between what are now the  
Catholic and Orthodox churches has never been healed.
THE NORMAN CONQUEST 
OF ENGLAND
(1066)
In 1066, the English king Edward 
the Confessor died childless, and  a dispute arose over who should succeed him. One of the claimants to the throne was Duke William of Normandy, who invaded England, defeated the English at the Battle  of Hastings, and was crowned king. This event forged a long-standing FURTHER EVENTS
embraced the idea of a united England with a distinctive culture based on Christianity and the English language.
THE SPREAD OF THE 
MISSISSIPPI CULTURE
(c.900)
There was a long tradition, lasting 
several millennia, of native North American groups based around large earth mounds that had been built for use in rituals or to house  the dwellings of the ruling class. These communities were mostly confined to local areas, from Ohio to Mississippi, but the Mississippi culture spread widely through eastern North America. They  grew maize intensively, worked copper, and developed hierarchical societies. Recognition of this complex culture has been a key element in debunking the idea that American Indian peoples were primitive and in forming a clearer understanding of their civilization.
OTTO I BECOMES  
HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR
(962)
German ruler Otto I suppressed revolts, united the Germanic tribes, and defeated outside aggressors such as the Magyars. In addition, he changed the relationship between the ruler and the Catholic church by exercising tight control over the clergy and using his close links to the church to increase  royal power. He also extended

link between England and mainland Europe, in which England’s rulers held French lands and spoke French. The Normans introduced a new ruling class, built castles and cathedrals, and transformed the English language with many new French-based words, all of which are legacies that still endure.
THE HUNDRED YEARS’ WAR
(1337–1453)
The Hundred Years’ War was a series of conflicts fought between England and France that began when Edward III asserted his  right to the French throne, a claim that the French Valois dynasty disputed. By the end of the war, English possessions in France  had been reduced to the coastal town of Calais and its immediate environs. This result transformed England from a power that aspired to be part of a larger European empire to an island nation separate from Europe. France, inspired especially by the leadership of  Joan of Arc, gained a stronger sense of national identity.
THE BATTLE OF GRUNWALD
(1410)
At the Battle of Grunwald, a combined Polish and Lithuanian force crushed the army of the Teutonic Knights. This military order, set up to assist crusaders and pilgrims, controlled large territories in Eastern Europe, including Prussia and Estonia,  and campaigned against Slavs  and pagans in the Baltic. This decisive battle put an end to the Knights’ military power, arrested German eastward expansion,  and left the Polish–Lithuanian alliance as the strongest power  in Eastern Europe.  
THE MONGOL INVASIONS 
OF JAPAN ARE REPULSED
(1274, 1281)
In the late 13th century, the 
Mongols were at the height of their power under their leader Kublai Khan. From their base in central Asia, they had moved east to take control of China. In 1271, they sent troops by sea to conquer Japan. The attack was unsuccessful, in part because the Mongol ships were caught in a typhoon, referred to by the Japanese as a kamikaze  
(divine wind). The Mongol defeat was decisive in checking their advance and shaping the idea  of a strong, independent Japan,  free from outside intervention or influence. This concept of Japanese nationhood lasted for centuries.
SCOTLAND UPHOLDS 
INDEPENDENCE AT BANNOCKBURN
(1314)
The Battle of Bannockburn, 
Scotland, was a major clash in an ongoing war between England and Scotland. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Scots, under King Robert Bruce, inflicted a heavy defeat on the English and their ruler Edward II. This left Bruce in full control of Scotland, from where he continued to lead raids on northern England. The war went on for decades, and Scotland remained independent until 1707. The battle was such a sweeping victory that it is still remembered as a key event in Scottish history, symbolizing the independence  from the rest of Britain to which many Scots still aspire. 
THE CONQUESTS OF 
TAMERLANE
(1370–1405)
Timur, also known as Tamerlane, 
was the last of the great nomadic Mongol conquerors. In an attempt to revive the great empire of Kublai Khan, he roamed widely across Europe and Asia, from northern India to Anatolia and Russia. By the end of the 14th century, he  had conquered Persia, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and eastern Russia, destroying Delhi in 1398, and pushing on toward China in 1405 but dying en route. His empire did not endure, and Mongol horse-based fighting techniques were no match for the firearms that increasingly drove warfare in the 15th century.
THE HUSSITE REVOLT
(1415–34)
The Hussites, followers of the religious reformer Jan Hus, were precursors of the Protestants who lived in Bohemia (modern Czech Republic, then part of the Austrian Habsburg empire) and fought their Catholic rulers for the freedom to worship in their own way. Hus  was executed for heresy in 1415, sparking a series of wars that eventually led to the defeat of the Hussites. The area remained under Catholic Hapsburg rule, but most  of the people of Bohemia stayed true to their Protestant beliefs. Their revolt against their Catholic rulers in 1618 triggered the Thirty Years’ War, when the Bohemian Protestants were again defeated.

The course of world events 
always looks different in retrospect from the way 
that it appears at the time, but the contrast in perspective is rarely as extreme as in the Early Modern Era, which spanned the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. Today, this period  is often viewed as the age during which Europe climbed toward world domination, but to Europeans living at the time it often seemed to be full of unprecedented disasters. The unity of Christendom was split by the Reformation, and sectarian conflict between Catholics and Protestants, combined with power struggles between competing royal dynasties, made Europe a place of frequent warfare—a continent tearing itself apart. Meanwhile,  the Muslim armies of the Ottoman Empire threatened the heartland  of Europe, seizing the Byzantine city of Constantinople and twice penetrating as far as Vienna. 
Yet historical retrospect certainly 
recognizes changes underway that were to make European nations the founders of the modern world. The flowering of arts and ideas in the Renaissance meant that Europe ceased to be a cultural backwater. Printing and paper, both originally invented in China, were used by Europeans to create mass-produced books that went on to revolutionize the dissemination of information. Gunpowder weapons, also invented by the Chinese, were deployed most effectively by European armies and navies. Above all, explorers and sailors from Europe’s western sea-board established oceanic trade routes that laid the foundations for the first global economy. 
The start of colonialism
The importance of Christopher Columbus’s transatlantic voyage  in 1492 cannot be exaggerated.  It established a permanent link between two entire ecosystems that had evolved in isolation from each another for almost 10,000 years. The initial impact on the inhabitants of the Americas was catastrophic. Eurasian diseases and the infamous brutality of the Spanish conquistadors decimated the population. A remarkably small number of European invaders conquered the most sophisticated American states with startling ease, laying potentially the entire New World open to European exploitation and colonization. 
However, the arrival of European 
sailors in Asia did not have the same dramatic impact. Powerful INTRODUCTION

countries, including India, Imperial China, the Mughal Empire, and the Japanese shogunate at first merely tolerated the Europeans as traders, allowing them to control only a few islands or enclaves along the coast, as long as they did not interfere or become too troublesome. 
Economic growth
From the second half of the 17th century, signs of economic growth  accelerated in Europe. Productivity of labor in trades and agriculture increased notably in areas like the Dutch Netherlands. New financial institutions, such as central banks and joint stock companies, laid the foundations of modern capitalism. Complex patterns of maritime trade linked European colonies in the Americas to Europe, Africa, and Asia. Slaves, mostly bought by European traders in West Africa, were transported in vast numbers to work on colonial plantations, so that in some parts of the New World people of African descent greatly outnumbered both Europeans and the native population. At home, Europeans consumed luxury goods from China and India, and products such as sugar and coffee from plantations in the Caribbean and Brazil. North America, the West Indies, and India were all regions of colonial contention—the precipitous decline of the Mughal Empire having opened up parts of India  to European territorial conquest.
Intellectual movements
Even at this stage, the degree of European ascendancy should not be exaggerated. China had gone through difficult times in the mid-17th century transition from the Ming to the Qing dynasty, but in  the 18th century, imperial China was enjoying a golden age of power and prosperity. The population of Europe had begun a steep increase to unprecedented levels—a result  of improved food production and declining epidemic diseases—  
but China also experienced rapid population growth. 
What really marked out Europe 
as unique at this time was the development of knowledge and thought. The 17th-century scientific revolution began a transformation  
of our understanding of the universe. The rationalist movement known as the Enlightenment challenged all preconceptions, traditions, and conventions. The modern world was under construction in the European mind.

of the Byzantine Empire. The loss  of this millennium-old Christian empire, which had once stretched virtually all the way around the Mediterranean, was a profound shock to the Christian world.

The Ottoman Turks had already

A weakening empire
The Byzantine Empire was already in terminal decline by the time Constantinople was taken. It had shrunk to include only the capital city, some land to its west, and the southern part of Greece. The decline began at the Battle of Manzikert (1071), during which  
the army of the Turkish Seljuk dynasty drove the Byzantines out  of their crucial territory in Anatolia. From this point, rival claims for the Byzantine crown, disputes over  tax, loss of trade revenue, and poor military leadership all contributed to the contraction of the empire.
In 1203, the Fourth Crusade— 
a western European expedition originally intended to conquer Jerusalem—became entangled in the empire’s politics. Some of the crusade leaders pledged to help restore the deposed Byzantine Emperor Isaac II Angelos in return for support for their expedition. They were initially successful: Angelos’ son was crowned as co- emperor but, in 1204, he in turn was deposed by a popular uprising. The Byzantine senate elected a young noble, Nicolas Canabus, as emperor, and he refused to back the crusaders. Denied their promised payments, the crusaders and their allies, the Venetians, responded with a ruthless attack on the city. They raped and killed civilians, looted churches, and demolished priceless works of art. Constantinople was all but destroyed.

ruled by him directly, and acted  
as buffer zones between Muslim and Christian areas. Some vassal states, including Bulgaria, Serbia, and Bosnia, were eventually absorbed into the larger empire; others retained their vassal status.
Government and military 
The Ottomans evolved a strong system of government that combined local administration  with central control. The sultan—whose brothers were customarily murdered at his accession—was supreme ruler. He had a council of advisers, later a deputy, who ruled on his behalf. Local areas were ruled by military governors (beys) under the emperor’s overall control, but local councils kept the beys’ authority in check. 
Non-Muslim communities 
within the empire were allowed a degree of self-rule through a system of separate courts called millets. The millets allowed Armenian, Jewish, and Orthodox Christian communities to rule according to their own laws in cases that did not involve Muslims. This balanced combination of central and local control enabled the Ottomans to THE FALL OF CONSTANTINOPLE

hold together a large and diverse 
empire for much longer than would have been possible with a more wholly centralized system.
Mehmet II Mehmet (1432–1481), the son of 
the Ottoman emperor Murad II, was born in Edirne, Turkey. As was usual for an heir to the Ottoman throne, Mehmet had an Islamic education, and at 11 years old was appointed governor of a province, Amasya, to gain experience of leadership. A year later, Murad abdicated in favor of his son, but shortly afterward was called back from his retirement in Anatolia to lend military support. “If you are the Sultan,” Mehmet wrote, “come and lead your armies. If I am the Sultan, I order you to come and lead my armies.” Mehmet’s second, main, rule was from 1451 to 1481. His victory at Constantinople was followed by a string of further conquests: the Morea (southern Greece), Serbia, the coast of the Black Sea, Wallachia, Bosnia, and part of the Crimea. He rebuilt Constantinople as his capital and founded mosques there, while also allowing Christians and Jews to worship freely. Known for his ruthless military leadership, he also welcomed humanists to the capital, encouraged culture,  
and founded a university.The Ottoman army was also  
crucial to the empire’s success.  It was technically advanced—employing cannon from the siege  of Constantinople onward—and tactically sophisticated. Its high-speed cavalry units could turn what looked like a retreat into a devastatingly effective flanking attack, surrounding the enemy in  a crescent-shaped formation that would take them by surprise. 
At the heart of the army were 
the Janissaries, a unit of infantry that began as the imperial guard and expanded to become the most feared elite force of the period. Initially, the unit was made up of men who, as children, had been abducted from Christian families  in the Balkans. Under the devsirme  
system, which was also known as the “blood tax” or “tribute in blood,” boys aged from eight to 18 were taken by Ottoman military, forcibly converted to Islam, and sent to live with Turkish families, where they learned the Turkish language and customs. They were then given rigorous military training, and  any who showed particular talent  were selected for specialized roles ranging from archers to engineers.

continued to explore the Caribbean,

He met with a mostly peaceful response from the native people, whom he observed might make good servants or slaves. He also noticed their gold jewelry, and

well as some native prisoners,

Columbus was to return to the 
Caribbean on three later voyages, bringing in his wake countless European visitors and settlers. 
Motivation to explore
The rulers and merchants of Western Europe wanted to explore the Atlantic for primarily economic reasons. Spices that would not grow in Europe’s climate, such as cinnamon, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, and pepper, were prized not only  for their taste but also because they could help to preserve foods. There was also an enthusiastic market  
for luxury goods such as silk and precious stones, commodities that came primarily from the islands of the Indonesian group, such as the Moluccas, which were known in Europe as the Spice Islands.  
Bringing such commodities 
across Asia by land was difficult and dangerous because of local wars and instabilities along the route; it was also costly, since during their journey goods would pass through many different merchants’ hands. There were certainly excellent economic reasons to develop sea routes: anyone who could find a more direct way of importing these goods to Western Europe would become very rich.

Christopher Columbus 
(c.1451–1506), an Italian-born navigator and trader 
from Genoa, made a journey in  
1492 that initiated a lasting contact between America and Europe, and changed the world. 
When he set out, Columbus  
was expecting to reach Asia, since no Europeans at the time knew that an entire continent blocked this route. When he reached an island  in the Bahamas after sailing for five weeks, he believed that he had arrived at the outer reaches of Indonesia. From there, Columbus Europeans develop a  
taste for Asian spices  
and luxury goods.

Christopher Columbus Born in Genoa, Christopher 
Columbus became a business agent for several prominent Genoese families and undertook trading voyages in Europe and along the African coast. 
Columbus followed his voyage 
to America with a second in 1493, during which he explored the Lesser and Greater Antilles, and set up a colony at La Isabela in what is now the Dominican Republic. His third voyage (1498–1500) took him to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola and on to Trinidad, where he found the coast of South America and guessed, from the size of the Orinoco River, that he had found a huge land mass. During this time, settlers complained to the Crown about the way he ran his Caribbean colony, and he was dismissed as governor. 
On his last voyage (1502–04) 
he sailed along the Central American coast, hoping to find  
a strait to the Indian Ocean. He returned to Spain in poor health and an increasingly disturbed state of mind, feeling he had not received the recognition and benefits he had been promised. Columbus died in 1506. Another reason why Europeans 
started to explore sea routes in the late Middle Ages was to investigate the possibility of establishing European colonies in Asia. These could act not only as trading posts, but also as bases for missionaries, who could convert the locals to Christianity. This they believed would help to reduce the perceived threat of Islam. 
By the 14th and 15th centuries, 
the Spanish, Portuguese, English, and Dutch had developed ocean-going ships, and trained sailors who could navigate over long distances. Explorers used various types of vessels, among the most successful of which was the caravel—a fast, lightweight, and extremely maneuverable ship that was usually equipped with a mix of square and lateen (triangular) sails. The lateen sails made it possible to sail to windward (into the wind), which allowed explorers to make progress even in variable wind conditions. Explorers also used the carrack, or nau, a larger vessel that was similarly rigged. On his first transatlantic voyage, Columbus  
took two caravels, each probably  
of 50–70 tons, and one carrack of about 100 tons, the extra capacity being useful for carrying stores. 
Skills and technology quickly 
developed in both shipbuilding  
and navigation. Sailors used the cross-staff—a basic sighting device—or later a mariner’s astrolabe, to calculate a vessel’s latitude. They achieved this by measuring angles, such as the angle of the sun to the horizon. They used a magnetic compass to gauge direction, and theircharts and knowledge of prevailing winds and currents improved with each voyage. 
Portuguese navigators
European navigators had been striking out into the Atlantic for many decades. Sailors from Bristol, England, for example, were sailing in the 1470s in search of a mythical island called “Brasil,” thought to be west of Ireland. The Portuguese established trading colonies on Madeira, and Prince Henry the Navigator, son of Portugal’s King John I, commissioned numerous journeys of exploration to the Azores in the 15th century. Henry had started the first school for oceanic navigation, with an astronomical observatory at Sagres, Portugal in about 1418. Here he promoted the study of navigation, map-making, and science. Henry sent ships down the west coast of Africa, to which  
he was particularly attracted by  the potential to trade in slaves and gold. His ships pushed southward, setting up trading posts along the

His third voyage (1498–1500) took him to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola and on to Trinidad, where he found the coast of South America and guessed, from the size of the Orinoco River, that he had found a huge land mass. During this time, settlers complained to the Crown about the way he ran his Caribbean colony, and he was dismissed as governor. 
On his last voyage (1502–04) 
he sailed along the Central American coast, hoping to find  
a strait to the Indian Ocean. He returned to Spain in poor health and an increasingly disturbed state of mind, feeling he had not received the recognition and benefits he had been promised. Columbus died in 1506. Another reason why Europeans 
started to explore sea routes in the late Middle Ages was to investigate the possibility of establishing European colonies in Asia. These could act not only as trading posts, but also as bases for missionaries, who could convert the locals to Christianity. This they believed would help to reduce the perceived threat of Islam. 
By the 14th and 15th centuries, 
the Spanish, Portuguese, English, and Dutch had developed ocean-going ships, and trained sailors who could navigate over long distances. Explorers used various types of vessels, among the most successful of which was the caravel—a fast, lightweight, and extremely maneuverable ship that was usually equipped with a mix of square and lateen (triangular) sails. The lateen sails made it possible to sail to windward (into the wind), which allowed explorers to make progress even in variable wind conditions. Explorers also used the carrack, or nau, a larger vessel that was similarly rigged. On his first transatlantic voyage, Columbus  
took two caravels, each probably  
of 50–70 tons, and one carrack of about 100 tons, the extra capacity being useful for carrying stores. 
Skills and technology quickly 
developed in both shipbuilding  
and navigation. Sailors used the cross-staff—a basic sighting device—or later a mariner’s astrolabe, to calculate a vessel’s latitude. They achieved this by measuring angles, such as the angle of the sun to the horizon. They used a magnetic compass to gauge direction, and theircharts and knowledge of prevailing winds and currents improved with each voyage. 
Portuguese navigators
European navigators had been striking out into the Atlantic for many decades. Sailors from Bristol, England, for example, were sailing in the 1470s in search of a mythical island called “Brasil,” thought to be west of Ireland. The Portuguese established trading colonies on Madeira, and Prince Henry the Navigator, son of Portugal’s King John I, commissioned numerous journeys of exploration to the Azores in the 15th century. Henry had started the first school for oceanic navigation, with an astronomical observatory at Sagres, Portugal in about 1418. Here he promoted the study of navigation, map-making, and science. Henry sent ships down the west coast of Africa, to which  
he was particularly attracted by  the potential to trade in slaves and gold. His ships pushed southward, setting up trading posts along the

way. Subsequent rulers continued  
to sponsor voyages and, in 1488, 
Portuguese captain Bartolomeu Dias rounded the southern tip of Africa. Soon another Portuguese navigator, Vasco da Gama, led the push to round the Cape and pressed on across the Indian Ocean, linking Europe and Asia for the first time  
by ocean route.
Since Portugal dominated the 
sea route along the African coast, Portugal’s European neighbor  
and rival Spain needed to find an alternative route, if it was to gain access to the riches of the East. Although educated people knew  
by this time that the Earth was round, they did not know about  
the existence of the Americas. An alternative way to the East seemed, therefore, to be to sail west across the Atlantic. This route seemed especially attractive to the many seamen—including Christopher Columbus—who believed the planet’s diameter to be rather smaller than it actually is. 
Seeking sponsorship
In 1485, Columbus presented to John II, king of Portugal, a plan to sail across the Atlantic to the Spice Islands. John refused to invest in  
the scheme, however. This was partly because Portugal was already exploring the West African coast with some success, and partly because the experts John consulted about the proposal were skeptical about the distances involved. 
Columbus cast his net more 
widely, seeking backing from the powerful maritime cities of Genoa and Venice, and sending his brother to England to do the same—but still he received no encouragement. He therefore turned to Ferdinand of CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS REACHES AMERICA
Aragon and Isabella of Castile, the “Catholic Monarchs” who jointly ruled Spain. At first they turned him down, their navigational consultants also skeptical about the length of his proposed route, but eventually, Such inhumanities and 
Barbarisms were committed... 
acts so foreign to human 
nature that I now tremble  
as I write.

 Spanish historian (c.1527)
Columbus’s voyage  was a bold undertaking. 
Despite a general understanding that the world 
was spherical, many believed the westward journey was doomed to fail, fearing the crew would die of thirst before ever reaching land.
On August 3rd, 
1492,  Columbus 
departed Spain with three ships: the Niña, Pinta, and Santa Maria.The voyage to America and back lasted seven months, from August 3rd, 1492—March 15th 1493.Provisions on  board  
the ships included vinegar, olive oil, wine, 
salted flour, biscuits,  
dry legumes, and  salted sardines.
The crew  consisted of  
87 men—20 on the Niña, 26 on the Pinta, and 41  on the Santa Maria.StartFinish
Columbus calculated that Asia was 2,400 miles away from Spain. In fact it is around 12,200 miles away. On October 12th,  1492,  the ships  
finally reached  the Bahamas.

after protracted negotiations, they 
agreed to sponsor the voyage. Securing a new trade route would certainly bring material rewards, but Isabella also saw the voyage in terms of a religious mission that could bring the light of Christianity to the East.
Columbus sails west
Having been granted viceroyship and governorship of any lands he could claim for Spain, plus other benefits including 10 percent of any revenues they yielded, Columbus set sail westward in 1492. He called at Gran Canaria before sailing west, sighting land five weeks later. In early 1493 he returned to Europe with two ships, the third having been wrecked off the coast of present-day Haiti, and was duly appointed Governor of the Indies.
Columbus’s second expedition 
was organized just a few months later. This involved 17 ships loaded with some 1,200 people who would found Spanish colonies in the Caribbean. As well as farmers and soldiers, the colonists included THE EARLY MODERN ERA

 THE TREATY OF TORDESILLAS ( 1494  )
Spain and Portugal signed a 
treaty on June 7, 1494, at Tordesillas in Spain, that 
resolved the countries’ disputes about the possession of newly discovered territory. The rulers settled on a meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde Islands as a line of demarcation. All the lands to the west of this line would belong to Spain; all those to the east would belong to Portugal. The line was chosen because of its location:  
it lies roughly halfway between  
the Cape Verde Islands, which already belonged to Portugal,  
and the Caribbean islands,  
which Christopher Columbus  
had claimed for Spain in 1492. IN CONTEXT

By the 1490s both countries were 
discovering substantial territories, including lands in the New World, although at this point the size and extent of the Americas was unclear to Europeans. In spite of the fact that the Spanish Crown had funded Columbus’s voyages, Spain’s claim to his discoveries was not clear-cut. The 1479 Alcaçovas treaty between the Catholic Monarchs of Spain  and the rulers of Portugal gave all newly discovered lands south of the Canary Islands to Portugal. When Columbus landed at Lisbon after his first voyage, he told John II, king of Portugal, that he was claiming Hispaniola and Cuba for his Spanish backers. John wrote to Spain’s rulers immediately to say that he was preparing to send his own ships to claim the Caribbean for Portugal. 
Legalizing possession
To prevent such disputes erupting each time a navigator made a  fresh discovery, the leaders of both countries decided to review the terms of the Alcaçovas treaty.  The papacy had been involved  in the 1479 treaty, and now Pope Alexander VI (a Spaniard) proposed a combined north–south and east–west dividing line, suggesting that any lands west and south of a line 100 leagues west and south of the Azores and Cape Verde Islands be allocated to Spain. John rejected the proposition, considering it to be biased in favor of his rivals, and eventually all parties agreed on the meridian between the Cape Verde Islands and the Caribbean.

the colonists, and as a result of  
their ruthless treatment, and slaves 
were brought in from Africa to replace them. Brazil, ruled from the mid-16th century by Portuguese governors-general, remained a colony until the early 19th century. 
The Spanish in America
Following Columbus’s transatlantic voyages and the settlement of the treaty, Spain turned increasingly to America, sponsoring expeditions that combined exploration with conquest and colonization. The first of these, led by Hernán Cortés, was to Mexico, which was then home to the small but rich Aztec Empire. The empire’s large, central capital was at Tenochtitlan (modern Mexico City). With just a small force of about 600 men, Cortés overthrew the million-strong empire, eventually killing its ruler, Moctezuma. Another Spanish leader, Francisco Pizarro, conquered the Inca Empire, which centered on Peru but also included Chile, Ecuador, and large parts of Bolivia and northwestern Argentina. Again with just a small force (180 men), Pizarro laid the foundations of another Spanish stronghold and source of great wealth in precious metals. Peruvian silver became the main source of Spain’s income from its colonies.
Several factors contributed to 
Cortés’ and Pizarro’s astounding conquests. The Aztecs were overwhelmed by a kind of battle THE TREATY OF TORDESILLAS
unknown to them, involving firearms and the single-minded slaughter of opponents—Aztec practice was to capture prisoners, whom they would later kill in ritual sacrifice. The Spanish were also helped by alliances they made  with local peoples who were hostile to the Aztecs. The result for Spain was a flow of wealth across the Atlantic and a secure base for building on their involvement in  the Americas.
Further Spanish colonization 
followed, including that of Colombia, known to the Spanish as New Granada. By the end of the 17th century, much of western and central South America was  
in Spanish hands. Conquered areas, and the people who lived in them, were parceled out to the Spanish conquistadors, who

undertook to convert the locals  
to Christianity. They did convert 
them, but they also made them perform forced labor, especially in the silver mines. Laborers fell victim to disease and exploitation—like their counterparts in Brazil, but on  
a lesser scale—and slaves from Africa were brought in to supplement their numbers. 
The Spanish Crown tried to 
control this large empire, appointing viceroys to rule over the settlers and the native American peoples, and taking a fifth of the profits from silver mining. Settlers increasingly resisted this external interference, however, and by the 19th century the empire was diminishing as areas from Colombia to Chile won their independence. 
Circumnavigation
The Treaty of Tordesillas set the  seal of approval on Spain’s activity in America, but this deterred neither Spain nor Portugal from looking for a westward route to eastern Asia,  a potential source of spices, luxury goods, and great wealth for traders from Europe. Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian navigator working for the Portuguese Crown, was one of the first to take this exploration further. He explored the coast of South America, and is remembered because America is named after him. The Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan was next to explore this route, this time on behalf of Spain. He believed that the Spice Islands could be less than halfway around the world when sailing west from the treaty line, which would give Spain a claim to them. In 1519 he set out with five ships in an ambitious attempt to make the first circumnavigation  
of the globe. Although Magellan himself died en route, some of the expedition survivors completed the voyage, giving Spain a basis for its claim to land in Southeast Asia. 
In 1529 the rival Crowns signed 
another treaty at Zaragoza. This agreement assigned the Philippines to Spain and the Moluccas to Portugal.
The treaty’s heritage
European countries not party to  the Tordesillas agreement simply ignored it, and soon began to move in to develop their own empires. Britain colonized North America, for example, the Dutch moved into the Spice Islands, and several European countries set up colonies in the Caribbean. The treaty did, however, influence a significant proportion of the world. It underlined a development that was already beginning in Europe in which wealth and influence were passing from the old central European powers (based in the Holy Roman Empire) to the coastal, maritime powers that looked to build empires in new territories. These empires brought both Spain and Portugal enormous riches, and their overseas empires left a significant cultural legacy: much of South and Central America is Spanish-speaking, and there is a major Portuguese heritage in parts of Africa and Asia, the greatest of all being in Brazil.

and deep civic pride in Italy laid  the foundations for one of the most significant intellectual movements in history: the Renaissance.
Il Duomo
At the time of the competition, Florence’s cathedral featured a  vast octagonal space toward its eastern end, but since work on the building began in 1296 no one had worked out how to make a dome to cover it.

THE EARLY MODERN ERA
The Renaissance in Italy
Meaning “rebirth,” the Renaissance was a movement that started in Italy and began to spread across Europe from the mid-14th century.  Its roots lay in the rediscovery of the culture of ancient Greece and Rome and it influenced all the arts, as well as science and scholarship. Painters, sculptors, and architects broke free from the traditions of medieval art. They visited the monuments of ancient Rome, looking at classical statues and the carvings on Roman buildings, and created works of art in the classical style. This new movement inspired architects,  such as Leon Battista Alberti and Brunelleschi, and a wave of great artists, including Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. Most of these figures were active in many fields—Brunelleschi was a sculptor and engineer as well as an architect; Michelangelo painted, sculpted, and wrote poetry; while da Vinci’s achievements spanned both the arts and the sciences.

led to the emergence of Renaissance Humanism in Italy, which involved studying the humanities—grammar, rhetoric, history, philosophy, and poetry—and, more broadly, a high regard for the dignity and potential of the human race.

Florence, Milan, Ferrara, and Venice—together with Rome,  from where the pope could exercise great secular (“temporal”) power  as well as being the spiritual head  of the Catholic Church. The city-states generated a lot of wealth from trade and—as in the case of Florence—banking. Their ruling families, such as the Gonzaga in Renaissance painters and sculptors sought to represent the physical world in a more realistic way than their Medieval predecessors: they valued anatomical accuracy and developed scientific methods of illustrating perspective. As in classical art, there was more focus on human beauty and the nude. 
There was also a revival of 
interest in classical learning, which was influenced by Greek scholars from the Byzantine Empire, who settled in Italy when Constantinople (the empire’s capital) fell in 1453. The émigrés  brought with them 
ancient Greek literary, historical, and philosophical texts, which had been lost to the West, and taught the Italians Greek so they could

Mantua, the d’Este in Ferrara, the 
Sforza in Milan, and the Medici in Florence, spent lavishly on palaces, churches, and works of art, and became patrons of many great Renaissance artists. These wealthy families also encouraged the revival of classical learning by employing scholars as tutors for their children. In addition, several members of the Medici family became popes.
Spread of the Renaissance
From the end of the 15th century, the Renaissance spread from Italy to other parts of Europe and a Northern Renaissance emerged. Northern countries, particularly  the Netherlands and Germany, produced their own great artists, such as Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528) and Hans Holbein the Younger (1497–1543)—both gifted realists. Renaissance Humanism also spread northward, but northern writers and philosophers, most notably Erasmus of Rotterdam (1466–1536), tended to place more emphasis on Christianity, education, and reform than their Italian counterparts.
The invention of printing  
using movable type by Johannes Gutenberg in Germany in the  1430s enabled Renaissance ideas to spread even more quickly. Before Gutenberg, the only way printed text was possible was for each page to be carved by hand into a block of wood, but as this was so laborious books were invariably written out by hand. Gutenberg’s method involved arranging individual metal letters and punctuation symbols in lines and pages; when many copies of  a page had been printed, the type could be taken apart and reused. He combined this new idea with the existing technology of paper-making and the kind of press used in wine production, and the result was the printing of multiple copies of books for the first time. 
Gutenberg’s invention had a 
major impact. It meant that books, which had previously been costly and took months to produce, were now easily available and much more affordable, so ideas and information could circulate quickly and reach more people. While the church had used mostly Latin as  its universal language, writers now wrote in their local tongues, and as a result literature in French, English, German, and other languages flourished. In addition, copies of the ancient classics were reproduced  in quantity, thus helping to spread ideas that were central to both the Renaissance and Humanism.
The Renaissance’s impact
By the mid-16th century, the influence of the Renaissance was waning in southern Europe, but it lasted slightly longer in the north. However, many great Renaissance works endured and they continued to inspire future generations of painters and architects. Indeed, the longstanding popularity of oil paintings and classical style of architecture, and the rise of Humanism, would all have been impossible without the movement that began with Brunelleschi in Florence in the 15th century.

Born in Florence, Filippo 
Brunelleschi (1377–1446) was the son of a civil servant, who educated Filippo in the hope that he would follow in his footsteps. However, Filippo was artistically talented and instead trained as a goldsmith and a clockmaker before becoming an architect. When he was around 25, he traveled to Rome with his friend, the sculptor Donatello, where he studied the remains of ancient Roman buildings and read the treatise On Architecture  by 
the Roman writer Vitruvius.  
In 1419, he won his first major commission—the design of an orphanage, the Ospedale degli Innocenti in Florence, which, with its arched loggia, is one of the first great Renaissance buildings. A number of other fine works, including chapels in Florentine churches and fortifications for the city, cemented his reputation, but the stunning dome of Il Duomo is his masterpiece. In addition to his buildings, Brunelleschi did important work on the theory of linear perspective, and designed machinery to produce special effects in theatrical productions.

Hundred Years’ War ends
The Battle of Castillon was the climax of the Hundred Years’ War, fought since 1337 by England and France, countries that had long been closely linked by their ruling families. By the time of Castillon, great changes had taken place in the fabric of European life, which profoundly altered the armies with which the French and English monarchs fought.
The Europe of the 15th century 
was principally a money economy, and everyone, including soldiers, expected to be paid. Kings were thus increasingly reliant on mercenaries who fought for pay. This was a sharp contrast to the feudal system that had existed previously, in which fighting men were provided by the nobility in exchange for land.   Eventually, rulers began employing mercenaries on a permanent basis: a standing army. But it wasn’t until the later 17th century that this model became the norm.
Cannons and guns
The kings who fought for control of France relied increasingly on large armies and expensive artillery.  Cannons, like those that secured  the French victory at Castillon, transformed warfare. The stout walls of medieval castles provided little defense against a cannonball.To better resist artillery rulers began, from the 16th century, to build a new type of fortification, the star fort. These forts had walls sunk into ditches to strengthen them against direct fire and also used cannons themselves in an active defense. 
At the same time, hand firearms 
that fired projectiles that smashed through the armor of mounted knights and required little skill to wield, gradually replaced the bow. Drilled infantry—wielding pikes and firearms—replaced massed ranks of archers, and formed the core of the new line of battle.
To pay for their new armies, 
rulers steadily began to centralize their domains. More efficient taxation systems and bureaucracies were established, curbing the power of an aristocracy whose influence was already diminished by the decline of the feudal system. 
Victory at Castillon, guaranteed 
by gunpowder, ensured the survival of an independent France that was becoming more like a centralized state and less like a feudal country. As a result of the French triumph, France was able to consolidate the territory under its control and the map of this part of western Europe began to take on its modern form. England, bereft of its European possessions, also became more centralized, and its rulers turned away from contintental Europe, leveraging the country’s resources to begin maritime exploration of the Atlantic and North America.

 THE COLUMBIAN EXCHANGE (1492 ONWARDS)
The arrival in the 1490s of 
the first Europeans in North and Central America 
reconnected ecosystems that had developed in isolation from one another for thousands of years. In the so-called Columbian Exchange, lives and economies that had altered only gradually over centuries were suddenly transformed by the influx of new crops, animals, technology, and pathogens. Many of the effects were unforeseen and misunderstood by both Europeans and American Indians at the time, but once the first landing had been made, there was no turning back. 
Food and farming
When Europeans began to settle  in the Americas, they brought with them their own domesticated animals and foods. The enormous range included citrus fruits, grapes, and bananas; coffee, sugar cane, rice, oats, and wheat; and cattle, sheep, pigs, and horses. To cultivate their crops and pasture their animals, the settlers cleared huge areas of woodland, destroying the habitats of some native wild species in the process, and unintentionally contaminating American fields with the seed of weeds such as dandelion and sow thistle. The exchange in the other direction brought potatoes, tomatoes, sweet corn, beans, pumpkins, squash, and tobacco to the Old World, as well as turkeys and guinea pigs.
The introduction of new staple 
crops transformed lives on both sides of the Atlantic. Potatoes and maize, carbohydrate-rich and easily grown, helped overcome chronic food shortages in Europe and, along with manioc and sweet potatoes, spread on to Africa and Asia. In the New World wheat, which thrived in the temperate latitudes of North and South America and in the IN CONTEXT

highlands of Mexico, eventually 
became a fundamental food crop for tens of millions of settlers. The arrival of horses in the New World was also revolutionary, permitting more effective and selective hunting, as well as facilitating travel and transport. 
Biological catastrophe
The most immediately devastating impact of the Columbian Exchange followed the introduction of new diseases into the Americas. The settlers and the chickens, cattle, black rats, and mosquitoes that accompanied them introduced contagious diseases to a people who had no biological defense against them. American Indians’ immune systems were not adapted to cope with alien diseases such  as smallpox, measles, chickenpox, influenza, malaria, and yellow fever. Once they were exposed to them, they began to die in the hundreds of thousands. Half the Cherokee nation died in a smallpox epidemic in 1738, and some other tribes were wiped out entirely. European explorers encountered and brought back American illnesses such as Chagas Disease, but the effect  
on Old World populations was negligible compared with the consequences of Old World pathogens in the New World. 
Exchange economics
From the start, the Columbian Exchange had a strong economic driver. Commodities ranging from gold and silver to coffee, tobacco, and cane sugar were transported on a vast scale, mostly to the benefit of European traders and plantation owners. 
Very soon, slave trading became 
a key part of this network too. The movement of people from continent to continent in vast numbers provided a continual supply of labor for expanding new economies at the cost of unspeakable oppression, misery, and early death to many generations. The dramatic and irrevocable changes brought about on both sides of the Atlantic by the Columbian Exchange continued  to shape lives for centuries.

New World peoples were using 
stone-age tools, had no wheeled vehicles, and few domesticated animals when they encountered Old World societies, who used guns and alphabets, farmed pigs, sheep, and cattle, and kept bees. The huge cultural changes that ensued, especially in the Americas, were complicated by the two societies’ very different attitudes to the “ownership” of nature and property; attitudes that would have significant consequences for future American Indian–European relations. The arrival of the horse led to the emergence of a new, nomadic American Indian tribe that came to dominate the southern Great Plains. Christianity started to spread in the New World, some elements of which fused with pre-Columbian beliefs in the old Inca and Aztec territories. West African religion also arrived, while introductions such as literacy and metal tools and machines, brought advances in education, agriculture, and the evolution of warfare.

The huge cultural changes that ensued, especially in the Americas, were complicated by the two societies’ very different attitudes to the “ownership” of nature and property; attitudes that would have significant consequences for future American Indian–European relations. The arrival of the horse led to the emergence of a new, nomadic American Indian tribe that came to dominate the southern Great Plains. Christianity started to spread in the New World, some elements of which fused with pre-Columbian beliefs in the old Inca and Aztec territories. West African religion also arrived, while introductions such as literacy and metal tools and machines, brought advances in education, agriculture, and the evolution of warfare.

 MARTIN LUTHER’S 95 THESES (1517)
In the autumn of 1517, Martin 
Luther, a monk and teacher of theology at the University of 
Wittenberg in Germany, set off a chain reaction that would transform Europe. Deeply concerned by what he saw as corrupt practices in the Catholic Church, he wrote a series of 95 theses—arguments—against them, which he then circulated within the university. According to some reports, he also nailed them to the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg. The theses were soon published more widely, prompting Pope Leo X to charge Luther  with heresy. Luther responded by breaking with the Catholic faith,  IN CONTEXT

so initiating the Reformation—the 
rise of churches based on reformed practices, and a focus on scripture rather than on priestly authority. Because of the churches’ origin in protests against Catholic practices and beliefs, they became known as Protestant churches.
Spread of the Reformation
Luther was not alone in seeking religious reform. Swiss preacher Ulrich Zwingli (1484–1531) led a Protestant church based in Zurich, and Frenchman John Calvin broke from the Catholic church in around 1530. Forced to flee France, he went to Geneva, Switzerland, where he supported the reform movement, eventually helping to shape Protestant doctrine.
Reformers’ beliefs did not 
necessarily concur. Calvinists were markedly different from Lutherans, and Anabaptists were persecuted by Protestants as well as Catholics for their radical views. Luther himself supported the brutal suppression of the Anabaptist-led Peasants’ Revolt in the 1520s. What the Protestants had in common was that their views brought them into fundamental theological conflict with the Catholic church. 
Reformers’ ideas spread via the 
relatively new technology of the printed word. Before movable type and presses made printed books possible in the 1450s, books were all written by hand in Latin, the international language of the church. Print allowed information to be reproduced cheaply and quickly, and demand rapidly grew for books written in the vernacular. Luther wrote his theses in Latin, but before long they had been translated and printed in German, French, English, and other languages. Books and pamphlets describing church abuses and outlining Protestant theology soon followed, and were printed in large numbers. THE EARLY MODERN ERA

A central idea in Protestant theology was that authority came not from the priesthood, but from scripture itself. For this reason, access to  the Bible was essential both for  the reformers and their followers.  Bibles printed in native European languages were appearing by the 16th century, Luther’s German translation of the New Testament was published in 1522, and a translated version of the whole  Bible including the Apocrypha followed in 1534. A year later, Miles Coverdale (1488–1569), sometime friar, preacher, and Bishop of Exeter, produced the first complete Bible  
in English. A French translation  
by theologian Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples (c.1450–1536) appeared between 1528 and 1532.

also Calvinists in France, where 
they were called Huguenots,  
although that country was split between Catholics and Protestants, who fought in the Wars of Religion of the second half of the 16th century. Spain, Portugal, and  Italy remained Catholic. 
In England, the seeds of reform 
were sown early. Many people objected to abuses such as the use of church funds to pay for clerics—including the Pope and foreign bishops—to lead a life of luxury. However, Protestant ideas were  not yet widely enough held for the faith to take hold. Things changed when Henry VIII of England broke with Rome in 1534, rejecting papal authority and proclaiming himself head of the church in England. As supreme ecclesiastical leader, he exercised his sole right to authorize the publication of the English Bible, the Coverdale Bible, but English religious practice and doctrine remained Catholic. A moderate form of Protestantism was later established in England under Henry’s daughter Elizabeth I.
Reformers risked their lives by 
speaking out at a time when heresy was punishable by death. Czech reformer Jan Hus had been burned at the stake in 1415, Zwingli died in a battle between Protestant and Catholic forces in 1531, and English Bible translator William Tyndale was executed in 1536. Luther, urged to recant by Pope Leo X in 1520, threw the written request on a bonfire, so church authorities handed him over to Frederick the Wise, Elector of Saxony and founder of the University of Wittenberg, for punishment. Frederick convened a formal enquiry or “Diet” at Worms, at which Emperor Charles V presided. The emperor rejected Luther’s arguments and banned his views in the empire, but Luther refused to recant. He was outlawed and excommunicated, but Frederick saved him from execution by faking his abduction, then hiding him  
at the Wartburg castle. Luther continued to write and organize, garnering increasing support. 
Powerful allies
Support from people in positions  of power assisted the spread of the Reformation. Like Henry VIII in England, the princes of Germany resented church wealth, taxation, and its independent law courts,  and were also eager to strengthen their own power. Throughout the Middle Ages, popes had made alliances with kings and emperors, and intervened in secular affairs. Many German princes wanted to prevent such alliances by cutting ties with Rome and removing bishops from their princedoms, so  
their support for the reformers was motivated by political expedience as well as personal piety.MARTIN LUTHER’S 95 THESES
In what would become the first in  
a long list of religiously motivated conflicts between Catholics and Protestants, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V invaded Lutheran territory in an effort to stamp out the movement. Lutherans united against him and, despite his triumph at the Battle of Mühlberg in 1547, he was unable to suppress them. A temporary compromise was eventually reached at Augsburg in 1555 when the emperor conceded that each prince within the empire could choose how to worship in his own domain. The peace was not to last, however; bitter divisions drawn  
by the Reformation would cause people across Europe to take up arms again, and the continent was ravaged by more than a century  
of religiously-motivated conflict. 
Reform from within 
Even before Luther wrote his 95 theses, a movement for reform had begun within the church. Inspired partly by Renaissance Humanism, it brought on a resurgence of scholarship and philosophy, and motivated churchmen such as Spaniard Francisco Ximenes,  
who produced a Bible with texts in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Aramaic. I do not accept the  
authority of popes and 
councils, for they  
have contradicted  
each other.

masterpieces of High Roman Baroque, by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the leading sculptor of his day.However, Luther’s clear theological 
challenges prompted the papacy to prepare a more widely considered response. In 1545, Paul III called together the Council of Trent at which bishops and cardinals reaffirmed Catholic doctrines, from the importance of the priesthood and sacraments to the legitimacy  of indulgences. But the council  also introduced reforms: it forbade abuses such as the holding of multiple offices by one priest, set up training seminaries for priests, and, in an attempt to slow the spread of Protestant doctrine, established a commission to specify which books Catholics were forbidden to read. In addition, a number of popes from Paul III onward lived austerely, appointed like-minded bishops,  
and reviewed papal finances.
Counter-Reformation  
The council met periodically for  18 years, and provoked a renewal and resurgence of Catholicism from within the church that is usually called the Counter-Reformation. The new Society of Jesus (also known as the order of Jesuits), founded by Spanish knight Ignatius Loyola in 1534, was approved by the pope in 1540 as an answer to the Reformation, and it spread  a powerful Counter-Reformation message across Europe. The contemporary revival of Christian art, which coincided with the flowering of the baroque style in Italy, added a vibrant emphasis. THE EARLY MODERN ERA
Baroque churches were imposing and ornate, filled with affecting sculptures, paintings, and strikingly posed biblical scenes. This potent propaganda served to underline the difference between Catholic churches and their Protestant counterparts, which were usually plain and undecorated. Baroque art, together with the zeal of reforming popes and Jesuit priests, helped to ensure that the Catholic church survived and flourished in countries such as Italy and Spain, even while the Protestant movement was gathering strength elsewhere. Europe, which had once been united under the pope in the  Roman Catholic Church, was now irrevocably split into Catholic and Protestant states. The seeds were sown for over a century of conflict as subjects took up arms against their rulers, kings and princes clashed, and nations attacked nations in the name of religion.

The trio landed some 65 ft (20 m) 
below in a dung heap stacked against the castle walls. Known  
as the Defenestration of Prague, this event began the Thirty Years’ War, a series of conflicts that devastated huge areas of Europe.
Religious differences
The Defenestration took place in  the wake of long-standing disputes between Catholics and Protestants about whether people should be allowed to worship freely in their own way. These differences affected much of Europe, and before war ignited Bohemia, there were violent religious conflicts in several other parts of the continent.
The disputes also involved 
rivalries for power between royal and aristocratic families who favored the different sides and used the conflicts to promote their own interests. The Netherlands,  for example, were home to many Protestants, but were ruled by Catholic Spain, whose ruler Philip II wanted to eliminate Protestantism. The largely Protestant Seven Provinces in the northern Low Countries revolted against the king’s rule. Religious clashes escalated into violence against  the perceived repression of the Habsburg Crown, leading to the formation of the independent Dutch Republic in the north of the region. 
Philip also planned to conquer 
England, which was moderately Protestant under Elizabeth I,  
and wanted to place a Catholic monarch on the English throne. In 1588, he sent his famous Armada to invade the country, but a combination of superior English THE DEFENESTRATION OF PRAGUE

an upper room in Prague Castle. The councillors were Catholics, working as regents for Ferdinand, the new king of Bohemia (now part of the Czech Republic); the Protestants wanted to be sure that the king  
and regents would not remove the religious freedoms that their former rulers had granted them. When  
the regents refused to give this assurance, the Protestants threw two of them, together with their clerk, out of the castle window.

naval tactics and stormy weather foiled the attempt, and England remained independent.
These religious differences 
proved particularly devastating in 16th-century France, where the substantial Protestant minority generally known as the Huguenots were widely persecuted. Many Protestants, especially Calvinist ministers, had their tongues cut out, or were burned at the stake.  
In the so-called St. Bartholomew’s Day Massacre of 1572, a group of targeted assassinations followed  by a wave of mob violence against the Huguenots lasted several weeks and left thousands dead. 
There followed a series of so- 
called Wars of Religion that lasted some 36 years. After eight periods of fighting, punctuated by uneasy truces and broken agreements,  
the wars came to an end in 1598 when the French king Henry IV, who had been a Protestant leader before taking the throne, promulgated the Edict of Nantes. This agreement gave the Huguenots certain rights, including freedom of religion in particular geographical areas. It also maintained Catholicism as  
the established religion in France, and obliged Protestants to observe Catholic holidays and pay church taxes. Disputes between the two sides still flared from time to time, however, and many Huguenots  
left France to seek safety in other countries such as England and  the Netherlands. 
Thirty Years’ War
The religious wars and disputes  
in France, the Netherlands, and England formed a troubled backdrop to the Thirty Years’ War in Europe. Most people in Bohemia were Protestants, but the area was part of the large Holy Roman Empire, which also included Germany, Austria, and Hungary, and was ruled by Catholic Habsburg emperors. The emperors acted as overlords to local kings, princes, and dukes. Some of them, notably Matthias, who was on the throne when the Defenestration took place, granted their Protestant subjects the right to worship as they wished. Matthias achieved this by ratifying the Letter of Majesty,  
a charter that had been signed by  
the previous emperor, Rudolf II, which guaranteed Protestants religious freedom and certain other basic rights. However, Matthias’ successor, the ardently Catholic Ferdinand, felt no obligation to honor the Letter of Majesty. He suppressed Protestant churches and appointed Catholics to high positions. This reignited a dispute that had existed in Bohemia since the first stirrings of the Protestant Reformation in the 15th century. 
After the Defenestration, both 
sides began preparing for war,  
but the process was accelerated when, in 1619, Matthias died. Ferdinand, who was already King  of Bohemia, then also became

own candidate, the Protestant 
Frederick V, Elector Palatine,  to rule in his stead.
Frederick’s credentials as a 
Protestant were excellent, not only because of his own faith, but also by marriage: his wife was Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of England’s Protestant king James I. However,  
in order to make Frederick king,  
the Bohemians had to depose a monarch who had been legally crowned, a move that deprived them of support from a number of their potential allies.
In 1620, the forces of Bohemia 
gathered to face those of the Holy Roman Empire at White Mountain, outside Prague. The forces seemed evenly matched: the Protestants under Frederick and Christian of Anhalt had a larger force, but the empire’s soldiers were experienced and well led by the Spanish–Flemish nobleman Field Marshall Tilly, and renowned general Albrecht von Wallenstein. After only one hour, Bohemian forces were crushed— 4,000 dead or taken prisoner compared to 700 of the empire’s forces—and Tilly entered Prague. Frederick fled, and many of the Protestant leaders were executed; ordinary Protestants were ordered to leave or convert to Catholicism; and Bohemia was left devastated, depopulated, and almost powerless. The area remained overwhelmingly Catholic into the 20th century. 
A destabilizing reform  
What happened in Bohemia was  a symptom of the instability of the wider Holy Roman Empire. In its history there had often been power struggles between emperors and local rulers, but a general balance  of power had emerged in which  
the emperor resolved to respect  
the rights of the individual states that made up the empire. This balance was upset by the changes of the Reformation, when Protestant beliefs strengthened in some places (such as Saxony), and Catholicism prevailed in others (such as Bavaria). A series of struggles then escalated into armed conflict. THE DEFENESTRATION OF PRAGUE
Gustavus achieved his decisive 
victory at Breitenfeld with a new, combined-arms approach in which infantry, artillery, and cavalry worked together in self-supporting units.Most of the battles were in the 
German and central European lands. In a few years the Habsburg imperial army, raised for Ferdinand and led by skilled military leader Albrecht Wallenstein, had crushed its rivals in Germany, and gone on to overwhelm Denmark. By 1629, Ferdinand was in a position to reclaim the lands that had passed into Protestant hands.
However, the Protestants still 
had two powerful allies. One was Sweden, under King Gustavus Adolphus, an able military leader; the other was France, a Catholic country, but one that wanted to curtail imperial power. In 1630, Gustavus arrived in Germany with a large army and won a significant victory at Breitenfeld in 1631, with financial assistance from France. 
In the mid-1630s the Habsburgs 
fought back, with the help of Spain. The conflict had now become an all-encompassing war involving virtually every one of Europe’s major countries in a struggle for power. The emperor wanted to win The [Protestant]

The end and the aftermath
By the 1640s, anti-imperial forces were regaining the upper hand. France defeated Spain at Rocroi  
in the Oise valley in 1643, while in 1645, Sweden met the imperial army at Junkau, southeast of Prague. Around half the 16,000-strong imperial army was killed in this bloody battle, and it looked as if  
the Swedes would march on Prague or Vienna. However by this point, both sides were exhausted, and no advance was made on either city. 
The battles of the Thirty Years’ 
War were conducted on a large scale. Forces of thousands came together in cavalry charges backed up by firearms, and large numbers of mercenaries were employed. The battles were fought with professional speed and ruthlessness, but what came after was sometimes even worse. Vast armies committed infamous atrocities as they pillaged huge areas of country to find food, and removed anything that might be useful to their enemies. Rural areas suffered particularly badly  at the hands of the scavenging troops—Germany lost around  20 percent of its population—but trade and manufacturing were also affected by the damage and devastation left behind. Central Europe took decades to recover from the war, although countries with strong trade networks and sea power, such as England and the Netherlands, fared better. 
Repeated artillery battles  
also wore down both armies. Exhausted, the sides eventually came together to make peace. THE EARLY MODERN ERA
Representatives of the empire, Spain, France, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic, as well as rulers  of German princedoms and cities, and other interested parties, assembled in 1648 in two north-German cities, Osnabrück and Münster, to agree the Peace  of Westphalia. The talks could not resolve basic differences between political and religious interests; they did however produce an agreement to end the war, and  the Peace established an overall balance of power among a number of independent nations.
Although Europe was now 
permanently divided into states that were predominantly Catholic or predominantly Protestant, they had agreed to learn to coexist with one another. The Peace set the precedent of creating agreements between nations by means of high-level diplomatic meetings, the like of which have played a key part in international relations ever since.

FOR THE SPIRIT OF REBELLION
 THE CONQUESTS OF AKBAR THE GREAT (1556)  
 
In February 1556, Abu Akbar 
became the new ruler of the Muslim Mughal dynasty in 
northern India, founded 30 years earlier by Turkic-Mongol invaders from Central Asia. The emperor’s forces immediately confronted the army of Hemu, a rival claimant to the throne of Delhi, at the Second Battle of Panipat. The Mughals inflicted a crushing defeat on Hemu, and regained territory lost by Akbar’s father, Humayun. Akbar  then gradually consolidated and extended his authority, annexing all of northern and part of central India. Rulers were deposed and killed and citizens massacred  as once-independent kingdoms became provinces of his empire.IN CONTEXT

Support and survival 
Akbar maintained the political 
unity of his sprawling realm by building an administration capable of expansion as new territories were incorporated. He created a network of highly paid nobles who served as provincial governors, or were employed as commanders of field armies or as part of the central military—the backbone of the empire. He also recruited talented men from across India (and Persia), both Muslim and Hindu, into his government, remunerating them with money or land. 
This system rewarded 
individual merit and loyalty, but kept the administration from becoming too centralized—a distinct advantage in an empire that was difficult to hold together from a single center. The emperor himself was often on the move, traveling with his court and harem in well-appointed tents.  
Another unifying factor was the 
spread of Islam, together with its arts and culture; however, Akbar believed in religious freedom and allowed the empire’s non-Muslim populations, which included a large Hindu majority, to live by their own faiths, laws, and customs. 
Interaction with Persia
Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, and Humayun, Akbar’s father, had developed diplomatic, cultural, and political links with another Islamic empire in the region, Safavid Persia, which stimulated Mughal interest in Persian fine arts such as miniature painting and  the “art of the book.” Akbar set up studios to produce illustrated books in the cities of Fatehpur Sikri  and Lahore (now in Pakistan), and Persian architects and artisans were brought to India to design  and construct palaces, forts, mosques, and public buildings, including Humayun’s tomb  in Delhi. This domed structure inspired major architectural innovations, and a unique Persian-influenced building style developed across the Indian subcontinent.
The Mughal Empire continued 
to prosper under Akbar’s son Jahangir, but later in the 17th century it declined amid religious conflict and economic problems. The emperors were defeated by Afghan invaders, then came under the control of the Marathas, Hindu warriors who dominated Indian affairs in the second half of the  18th century, and finally were taken over by the British after Britain defeated the Marathas in 1818. 
■Akbar
Akbar was just 13 years old 
when he inherited the Mughal throne, and initially ruled under a regent, Bairam Khan, who assisted him in forcibly unifying India’s collection  
of regional kingdoms into a single, centralized political system within which the emperor was the supreme source of authority. 
Under Akbar, the dynasty 
became an artistic as well as military power. Painting and literature blossomed under  
the emperor’s patronage—although he himself was illiterate, he acquired a library of 24,000 books. His capital at Fatehpur Sikri also became a center for religious debate and his court a place of culture and learning. Although he never renounced Islam, Akbar was open to the ideas of other faiths, and he invited Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist philosophers to debate with the Muslim theologians at his court. He even conceived a new religion, which combined elements of all these faiths, with himself as the deity.

North American colonization
BEFORE
1585  English settlers found 
Roanoke Island Colony in North Carolina, but within  
five years it is abandoned.
1607  The first permanent 
English settlement in North 
America is founded at Jamestown, Virginia.
1608  French settlers found 
Quebec in Canada.

1629  English settlers found 
the Massachusetts Bay Colony on North America’s east coast.
1681  English Quaker  
William Penn founds 
Pennsylvania to provide a refuge for fellow Quakers.
1732  English settlers  
found Georgia, the last of  
the 13 original colonies on  
the northeast coast.
The colonists develop a form of government based 
on the pursuit of religious freedom, following the 
English parliamentary model.  English Protestants  seeking religious freedom  sail  
to North America  on the Mayflower .
Other English colonies are 
founded by companies  granted 
royal charters  from the Crown .More religious separatists   
follow, swelling the  
colony’s  population .In 1620, a group of English 
people who could not legally worship as they wished to in 
England set sail across the Atlantic to begin a new life in America. This group later became known as the Pilgrims. They set off on two ships, but one proved unseaworthy so they had to continue in just one, the Mayflower . Winter storms ravaged 
the 66-day crossing and the ship’s main beam fractured. While still aboard, the Pilgrims drew up the Mayflower
 Compact , which pledged 
their loyalty to the Crown but also asserted their right to make their own laws within the English legal framework. They settled at Plymouth and, although many died that first winter, their community endured.
Early colonization 
At that time, England, like other countries, was competing to establish colonies in North America. Jamestown had been founded thirteen years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, but it was not a religious community. The Colony of Virginia, centered around Jamestown, had been established by English colonists in 1607 under

a charter from the Crown, and was their first permanent settlement in the Americas. French explorers had established fur trading posts up  the rivers of Canada; Dutch and Swedish colonists arrived in North America in the early 17th century, and in 1613 the Dutch established  a trading post on the western shore  of Manhattan Island. 
Government and trade
Both Plymouth and Jamestown developed representative institutions in which colonists elected officials to govern their own affairs. Inspired by the English parliamentary model, and growing out of the assertion of rights articulated in the Mayflower Compact , these early developments 
established a model of self-rule  that came to characterize English colonization in North America. 
Each colony had a governor, 
appointed by the British monarch, and a legislature, elected by the colonists. There was often tension between the two, because the legislature had to work within the framework of existing English law. However, the king and government in London, working with the governor, saw the colonies as a resource, rich in raw materials, that they could exploit to their advantage. 
To ensure America remained a 
ready market for British industry, colonial trade was restricted by the Navigation Acts, which required that all commodity trade take  
place in British ships crewed by British sailors. The colonists came to see these measures as a willful suppression of their trade and manufacturing. Tensions arose  on both sides of the Atlantic as British and colonial merchants sought to protect their interests.
Colonial growth
Relations between the colonists and the indigenous peoples of the East Coast were also starting to strain. The increasing colonial population put pressure on land and resources, pushing people west to settle on land belonging to American Indians. 
The groups struggled to coexist 
harmoniously. An uneasy peace, punctuated by violence, typified relations between settlers and American Indians for many years.

Religious persecution
In the early 17th century, the 
English were legally obliged to worship as prescribed by the Church of England. Although the English church had already broken from the Catholic Church, many people still felt that its hierarchical priesthood and set rituals, hymns, and prayers were Catholic features that should be swept away. 
Puritans, so-called because 
of their desire for religious purity, hoped to reform the church from within. Other groups, known as Separatists, set up their own “separate” congregations, but when their leaders were imprisoned or even executed, they moved to the more tolerant Netherlands. Here they could adopt the simpler form of worship they preferred, but it was very hard to earn  
a living because the country’s professional guilds were closed to them. This is part of the reason that the Pilgrims, and later others, decided to seek  
a new life in North America.The Mayflower  attempted to depart 
England on three occasions: from 
Southampton and then Dartmouth  in August, and finally from Plymouth  on September 6, 1620.

 THE EXECUTION OF CHARLES I (1649)
During the 1640s, England 
was plunged into a series of wars, fought to decide 
the future of the country and known collectively as the English Civil War. On one side were the Royalists—predominantly landed gentry and aristocrats who supported King Charles I and  his right to rule independently of parliament. On the other were the Parliamentarians—mainly smaller landowners and tradesmen, many of whom held Puritan beliefs and disliked Charles’s autocratic stance.

with the king, leaving the remainder 
(known as the Rump Parliament) to vote to end the monarchy. Charles was tried for treason against England and was beheaded in 1649, after which England began an 11-year period as a republic.
The causes of war
King Charles I and parliament were natural opponents. Charles was sympathetic to Catholics while parliament was Protestant, and  he believed in the divine right of kings—the idea that the monarch’s appointment is approved by God and so he or she has absolute power. 
The clash first came to a head 
over the king’s repeated attempts to raise money for a war in France. Parliament tried to curb his power to do so by introducing a Petition of Right in 1628, making it a necessity for its members to approve taxation. However, Charles got around this by levying taxes using antiquated medieval laws, selling trading monopolies to raise cash, and ruling without parliament. In 1640, the king was forced to call parliament for the first time in 11 years to raise money to quell a Scottish revolt. Once called, parliament tried to bring in further measures to limit his power, such as making it illegal for the king to dissolve parliament, but he responded by trying to arrest five MPs. The dispute escalated into the First Civil War in 1642. 
The war and its effects
Initially, the Royalists gained  the upper hand but in 1644 the Parliamentarians reorganized their troops under Oliver Cromwell. With their disciplined, professional approach, this “New Model Army” forced Charles to surrender in 1646. However, the king restarted the war two years later, and this Second Civil War—which ended  in a Royalist defeat at the Battle of Preston in 1648—began the chain of events that led to his execution in 1649 and the formation of a republic under Cromwell called  the Commonwealth of England. 
Like Charles, Cromwell found 
relations with parliament difficult, but he tried to bring in reforms.  
King Charles I  
of EnglandThe son of Stuart King James I  
of England (King James VI of 
Scotland) and Anne of Denmark, Charles was born in 1600 and became king in 1625. From the start, he alienated both subjects and parliament with his demands for taxation (mostly to fund wars in France) and his assertion of  
his divine right to rule. He also clashed with the church because of his sympathies with Catholicism (he was married to the French Catholic princess, Henrietta Maria). In addition, he was unpopular in Scotland, where he tried to replace the prevailing presbyterian system of church governance (without bishops) with the more hierarchical episcopal system (with bishops, following the Anglican model), which led to political and military conflict in 1639 and 1640 (known as the Bishops’ War). During the English  
Civil War, he took an active part in leading the Royalist armies until he was captured; initially, he was put under house arrest, then he was imprisoned before his execution in 1649. He continued to assert his divine right to rule during his trial.He ruled with stern Puritan authority, 
imposing it ruthlessly on the Scots and the Irish. Soon after he died, the country—perhaps tired of Puritan austerity—welcomed Charles I’s exiled son home to reign. Charles II agreed to limitations on royal  power and to uphold the Protestant faith, but his heir—his Catholic brother James II—clashed with Anglican bishops and offended Protestants by offering prominent positions to Catholics. 
Fears of having another Catholic 
king mounted until, in 1688, in what became known as the Glorious Revolution, James was deposed. The king was sent into exile and replaced by his Protestant daughter Mary, who ruled with her Dutch husband William of Orange. In 1689, William and Mary accepted a Bill of Rights, which ensured their subjects had basic civil liberties, such as trial by jury, and making the monarchy subject to the law of the land. Britain has remained a constitutional monarchy, in which no king or queen could defy Parliament as Charles I did, ever since.

over the king’s repeated attempts to raise money for a war in France. Parliament tried to curb his power to do so by introducing a Petition of Right in 1628, making it a necessity for its members to approve taxation. However, Charles got around this by levying taxes using antiquated medieval laws, selling trading monopolies to raise cash, and ruling without parliament. In 1640, the king was forced to call parliament for the first time in 11 years to raise money to quell a Scottish revolt. Once called, parliament tried to bring in further measures to limit his power, such as making it illegal for the king to dissolve parliament, but he responded by trying to arrest five MPs. The dispute escalated into the First Civil War in 1642. 
The war and its effects
Initially, the Royalists gained  the upper hand but in 1644 the Parliamentarians reorganized their troops under Oliver Cromwell. With their disciplined, professional approach, this “New Model Army” forced Charles to surrender in 1646. However, the king restarted the war two years later, and this Second Civil War—which ended  in a Royalist defeat at the Battle of Preston in 1648—began the chain of events that led to his execution in 1649 and the formation of a republic under Cromwell called  the Commonwealth of England. 
Like Charles, Cromwell found 
relations with parliament difficult, but he tried to bring in reforms.  
King Charles I  
of EnglandThe son of Stuart King James I  
of England (King James VI of 
Scotland) and Anne of Denmark, Charles was born in 1600 and became king in 1625. From the start, he alienated both subjects and parliament with his demands for taxation (mostly to fund wars in France) and his assertion of  
his divine right to rule. He also clashed with the church because of his sympathies with Catholicism (he was married to the French Catholic princess, Henrietta Maria). In addition, he was unpopular in Scotland, where he tried to replace the prevailing presbyterian system of church governance (without bishops) with the more hierarchical episcopal system (with bishops, following the Anglican model), which led to political and military conflict in 1639 and 1640 (known as the Bishops’ War). During the English  
Civil War, he took an active part in leading the Royalist armies until he was captured; initially, he was put under house arrest, then he was imprisoned before his execution in 1649. He continued to assert his divine right to rule during his trial.He ruled with stern Puritan authority, 
imposing it ruthlessly on the Scots and the Irish. Soon after he died, the country—perhaps tired of Puritan austerity—welcomed Charles I’s exiled son home to reign. Charles II agreed to limitations on royal  power and to uphold the Protestant faith, but his heir—his Catholic brother James II—clashed with Anglican bishops and offended Protestants by offering prominent positions to Catholics. 
Fears of having another Catholic 
king mounted until, in 1688, in what became known as the Glorious Revolution, James was deposed. The king was sent into exile and replaced by his Protestant daughter Mary, who ruled with her Dutch husband William of Orange. In 1689, William and Mary accepted a Bill of Rights, which ensured their subjects had basic civil liberties, such as trial by jury, and making the monarchy subject to the law of the land. Britain has remained a constitutional monarchy, in which no king or queen could defy Parliament as Charles I did, ever since.

In 1660, the Company of Royal 
Adventurers Trading to Africa was established in England. 
Its charter, endorsed by the king, gave its ships the exclusive right  to trade on the West African coast, and permitted its members to set up forts there, in exchange for giving the English Crown half the resulting profits. Twelve years later, the company was reorganized as the Royal African Company and given still greater powers: to build forts and “factories” (where slaves were held before being shipped over the Atlantic), and employ its own troops. The company’s particular significance is due to its crucial role in facilitating and developing the  IN CONTEXT

Europeans to ship slaves from West 
Africa. By the 16th century, the Portugese were bringing slaves  in huge numbers to Brazil to work  on sugar cane plantations. Brazil remained the biggest destination for the import of African slaves until the outlawing of the trade. The first English slaving expeditions took place in the 1560s, in which merchants bought captured slaves from African rulers. During the 17th century, with the increase of English colonization, the market for African slaves grew and the Royal African Company took full advantage of it.
Triangular trade
The transatlantic slave trade soon became part of a larger triangular trading network, in which ships took slaves from Africa to the Americas; refilled the holds with goods to transport to Europe; then took European manufactured goods on to Africa for sale, completing the triangle. Ships carried commodities such as sugar, molasses, and coffee from the Caribbean to England; rice, indigo, cotton, and tobacco from the southern colonies in North America; and furs, timber, and rum from the northeast. On the England-  
to-Africa leg, they carried a range of items including cloth, guns, iron, and beer. Goods such as ivory and gold were carried directly from Africa to Europe, not as part of the triangular trade but still bolstering the system. 
The trade network brought  
huge profits to plantation owners  in the Americas, and to English manufacturers, as well as to the merchants who dealt in the slaves and other goods. Port operators, West African leaders who sold slaves, bankers who loaned money for expeditions, and even English factory workers whose jobs depended on raw materials imported from abroad, all benefited. 
As a key part of this trading 
network, the slave trade made possible the rapid rise of Western capitalism in the 18th century. Even factories some distance away from England’s trading ports became involved. A notable example was the business of arms manufacture, which was based in the English Midlands at population centers such as Birmingham, conveniently close to supplies of iron. Some 150,000 guns, mostly made in these Midland factories, were exported to West Africa every year; almost all of them

were then exchanged with African 
merchants for slaves. English cutlery from Birmingham and Sheffield was also traded in the same way. So many people had vested interests in the triangular trade that it became difficult for European politicians even to criticize the system, let alone abolish it.
The number of people who were 
enslaved and traded was vast. It has been estimated that by the time the slave trade was outlawed in Britain in 1807, British merchants had forced some 3 million Africans into lives of slavery in the Americas. Unknown numbers of people did not even reach America, but died en route in the appalling conditions on board the slave ships. It is likely that even more were carried by Portuguese traders bound for Brazil; ships from other nations carried smaller numbers.

European colonies
Spanish, Dutch, and French settlers pioneered the plantation system in the Caribbean, producing crops such as sugar and coffee on huge farms, or plantations. Their principal Caribbean colonies included Cuba (a colony of Spain), Haiti (France), and the Dutch Antilles (the Netherlands). The use of slave labor on these plantations generated substantial profits for owners. The British presence in the area increased in the 17th century, when Britain’s most successful colony was Barbados, where there were 46,000 slaves by the 1680s. In the 18th century there was also a sugar boom in Jamaica. 
Most of the native populations 
were wiped out in the European conquests, and European workers did not fare well in the local conditions, so plantation owners increasingly relied on merciless exploitation of slaves. Slavery was also prevalent in the colonies of North America, especially the southern areas where crops such as tobacco were grown on plantations. Slaves were often treated as non-human objects, forced into labor and subjected to cruelties such as beating, branding, and worse. 
Slavery beyond the triangle
Colonists from Europe also practiced slavery beyond the Atlantic trading triangle. The Dutch pioneered slave trading in Southeast Asia, and also traded across the Indian Ocean with areas such as Madagascar and Mauritius. Most of this trading was conducted under the auspices of the Dutch East India Company, which had its eastern headquarters on the island of Jakarta, known to the Dutch as Batavia, as well as a base in Sri Lanka. From these points they sent slaves around  the Indian Ocean, from eastern THE EARLY MODERN ERA
Indonesia to southern Africa. Once the Portuguese and English had set up bases, there was also further slave trading along the Indian coast. 
The slave trade was not solely 
carried out by Europeans. Muslim merchants also transported slaves from East Africa for sale elsewhere in the Muslim world. 
However, the triangular trade 
was a crucial element in the creation of a global economy run  by Europeans and their colonial offshoots for their own profits. It permitted a phenomenal growth in the wealth of countries that ran the trade. In Britain, for example, the value of foreign trade rose from £10 million at the beginning of the  18th century to £40 million at  the end. But the human cost of the trade in slaves, which influenced patterns of thought and behavior  for centuries to come, remains incalculable today.

Unusually, the Dutch government had granted  the company the power not only to trade, but also to build fortifications, establish settlements, raise armies, and enter into treaties with foreign rulers. Since the organization had  
a huge network of ships, ports, and personnel, it required considerable funding and many investors. The Amsterdam Stock Exchange was IN CONTEXT

An expanding economy
In the 17th century, the Netherlands  was growing economically despite being involved in a long war with Spain. The northern part of the region (the Dutch Republic, which was Protestant) had split from the southern half (Flanders, which was Catholic) in the late 16th century. The Republic consisted of seven separate northern provinces, each with a great deal of independence but under the umbrella of a federal government called the States-General. Protestant merchants who had lived in Catholic cities, such  
as Antwerp, moved north to escape persecution, taking with them  their capital and trading links.  Also, many Flemish artisans who were skilled in textile production (primarily weaving wool, silk, and linen) emigrated to the northern cities of Haarlem, Leiden, and Amsterdam, boosting the Dutch Republic’s economy further. 
As the 17th century progressed, 
the Republic really began to prosper. Various factors came together to make this small region successful. Most importantly, the nation had a strong tradition of seafaring, giving it a huge advantage over many other countries. In addition, its citizens had a strong work ethic—largely due to the Protestant belief that THE EARLY MODERN ERA
worldly work was a duty and a route to salvation—so productivity was high. There was also a growing population (especially of the urban middle classes) and an expanding major city—Amsterdam—which proved an ideal center for trade.  All of these contributing factors resulted in the Dutch economy moving increasingly toward shipping, trading, and finance.
Exploration and trade
As a coastal nation, the Dutch Republic produced notable sailors and explorers, so long-distance trading was a natural consequence of the country’s maritime history.  In addition, advancements in ship-building technology in the Republic enabled the Dutch merchant fleet to expand rapidly; by 1670, the Dutch had more merchant ships than the rest of Europe put together.

Agricultural revolution
The expanding population of  
the Dutch Republic in the 17th 
century encouraged farmers  
to make agriculture much more productive. In large part, this was achieved through continued land reclamation—a process that was already well underway by the late Middle Ages. The Dutch also changed the way they used their land. Instead of growing grain one year and letting the land lie fallow the next, farmers began planting certain nitrogen-producing crops (such as peas, turnips, and clover, which they could use as animal feed), in order to improve the soil ready for the next corn crop. Growing more fodder meant that farmers could keep larger herds, thereby increasing production of meat and milk as well as manure, which could be used as fertilizer. This greater productivity helped to sustain a growing population, although some wheat still had  
to be imported to make up the shortfall. It also freed up larger segments of the population to work in trade or finance rather than agriculture.

The expanding merchant class saw 
large potential profits in the spice trade with Asia and, as in other maritime cultures such as Spain and Portugal, navigators sought new sea routes to the east. The Dutch traveled all over the globe and set up colonies, including one in North America: New Amsterdam, which they officially settled in 1624 and was renamed New York when the British took over. In 1596, the Dutch explorer Willem Barentsz tried to find a northern passage to Asia and in the process discovered Svalbard (Spitsbergen), which later became  a destination for Dutch whalers. 
Most importantly for their 
prosperity, from 1595 the Dutch began to make regular journeys  to Southeast Asia to trade in spices, particularly pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon. They established colonies in the region and founded the city of Batavia, later renamed Jakarta. With this permanent base, the Dutch had the ability to trade long-term, producing a massive boost to their economy.
A need for investment
While the wealth generated by exploration and trade was injected back into the Dutch economy, at the same time investment was required to cover the considerable costs of overseas expeditions. A trading voyage to Asia in the 17th century was a very risky venture—the potential profits were high, but storms at sea, pirates, warfare, or an accident could lead to the loss  of a ship, crew, or cargo and wipe out all the profits. It therefore made sense for many people to invest in each voyage and spread the risk, rather than one entity shouldering all the costs and responsibilities. Private trading companies were set up, each investing a small amount in a larger whole, and all being  well they would then receive a commensurate share of the profits. 
Birth of the Exchange
In 1602, these trading companies merged to form the Dutch East India Company, and shares in the THE OPENING OF THE AMSTERDAM STOCK EXCHANGE

new Stock Exchange in Amsterdam. It was established at the outset that the owners could buy and sell these shares, and very quickly other companies were listing their own shares on the Stock Exchange in order to raise money. The ease of buying and selling shares meant that the Stock Exchange became very busy indeed, fueling the growth of capitalism in this part  of Europe; increased investment resulted in more industry, which then led to further investment and the generation of greater wealth. 
A history of trading
The Amsterdam Stock Exchange did not develop in a vacuum. Buying and selling securities—tradable financial assets such as shares—already had a long history in Europe. By the 14th century, possibly earlier, merchants in rich Italian trading cities, such as Venice and Genoa, had traded in securities. However, the prevailing conditions in the Netherlands in the 17th century meant that the market was especially buoyant. Since the 16th century, there had If one were to lead a

been a strong financial market in Amsterdam, where there was a tradition of trading in commodities and speculation in everything from whale oil to tulips. The idea of buying and selling shares therefore appealed in this entrepreneurial society, especially as there was  a good prospect of healthy profits from the Asian trade. In addition, the unique way in which the exchange traded—opening for limited hours only—encouraged rapid buying and selling and produced a very fluid market. 
Boosts to the economy
The opening of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange was followed in 1609 by the foundation of the Bank of Amsterdam—the forerunner of modern national banks. The bank provided a secure place to keep money and bullion, and it assured that local currency kept its value.  It thus helped to make the Dutch Republic more financially secure, underpinning the vigorous and often risky trading activity that went on in this burgeoning market.
In 1623, the market had a further 
boost when the Dutch East India Company negotiated a new charter, paying investors a regular dividend and permitting those who wanted to leave the company to sell their shares on the Stock Exchange.

been a strong financial market in 
Amsterdam, where there was a tradition of trading in commodities and speculation in everything from whale oil to tulips. The idea of buying and selling shares therefore appealed in this entrepreneurial society, especially as there was  a good prospect of healthy profits from the Asian trade. In addition, the unique way in which the exchange traded—opening for limited hours only—encouraged rapid buying and selling and produced a very fluid market. 
Boosts to the economy
The opening of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange was followed in 1609 by the foundation of the Bank of Amsterdam—the forerunner of modern national banks. The bank provided a secure place to keep money and bullion, and it assured that local currency kept its value.  It thus helped to make the Dutch Republic more financially secure, underpinning the vigorous and often risky trading activity that went on in this burgeoning market.
In 1623, the market had a further 
boost when the Dutch East India Company negotiated a new charter, paying investors a regular dividend and permitting those who wanted to leave the company to sell their shares on the Stock Exchange. This action further increased trade on the Stock Market, which was also pioneering other lucrative activities such as futures trading.

 THE BATTLE OF SEKIGAHARA (1600)
On October 21, 1600 there 
was a momentous battle in Sekigahara, central Japan, 
between two warring factions—the Eastern and Western armies—who were both fighting for control of the country. The Eastern Army, under the leadership of the lord Tokugawa Ieyasu, won a decisive victory. Three years later, the Emperor of Japan awarded Ieyasu the title of shogun, granting him the power to rule the country on the emperor’s behalf. Ieyasu brought stability and peace to Japan and transferred the nation’s capital to Edo (now Tokyo), creating a new focus for Japanese culture as well as a central power base.

by the 1460s the local feudal lords 
(daimyos ) were so powerful that  
few shoguns had control over them, as they and their armies of samurai warriors fought to win the right to appoint the shogun’s successor. By the time of the Battle of Sekigahara, Japan had endured bitter factional struggles between its ruling classes for over a century.
Ieyasu’s victory at the battle  
put an end to this Warring States Period. His steady rule, followed by that of the Tokugawa shoguns who succeeded him, ushered in a 250-year period of stability.
The Tokugawa shoguns
In many respects, the Tokugawa shoguns modeled themselves on earlier rulers—particularly Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Although he was not sufficiently high-born to become a shogun, Hideyoshi (who ruled under the lesser title of imperial regent) had brought unity to Japan in the 1580s by imposing a military, feudal style of rule whereby he wielded great power through the daimyos and their samurai warriors. The Tokugawa shoguns decided to govern in the same way, with the daimyos keeping order in their local areas. As an extra precaution, Ieyasu made the daimyos spend alternate years in Edo to ensure they would not build up local power bases; he also suppressed rivals ruthlessly. 
The shoguns encouraged an 
ethic of loyalty and developed an elite bureaucracy. They improved Japan’s road network, promoted education, and standardized the currency. The shogunate also tried to reduce foreign influence in Japan by expelling foreigners and limiting contact with the outside world. Exceptions were made for strictly controlled trade with the Chinese, Koreans, and the Dutch East India Company; all other Europeans were distrusted, as the shoguns believed that they had plans to convert the Japanese to Christianity and gain political power. Furthermore, the Japanese people were forbidden to travel and build ocean-going ships. This policy of isolation virtually cut off Japan from Western influence until the mid-19th century. 
The “floating world”
The capital Edo became the center of a thriving urban culture during the Tokugawa shogunate. Japanese literary forms, such as the haiku   
(a short poem consisting of three lines and 17 syllables) flourished,  as did the distinctive theatrical forms of kabuki  (which combines 
theater and dance) and the bunraku  
puppetry theater. It was also a time of major achievements in the visual arts, particularly landscape painting and woodblock printing. 
The capital’s elite became 
increasingly hedonistic, with their lifestyle frequently described as the “floating world” ( ukiyo ). Originally, 
Buddhists had used the term ukiyo  
to mean “sorrowful world,” reflecting their opinion that life on earth was transitory and expressing a desire to reach a more permanent place, free from suffering and all earthly desires. However, in the Edo Period the homonym 
ukiyo  (“floating”) was 
used to describe the joyful aspect of the ephemeral material world, reflecting the pleasure-seeking mood of the day. 
■Tokugawa Ieyasu The samurai leader Tokugawa 
Ieyasu (1542–1616) was the son  
of a minor Japanese warlord from Mikawa in central Japan. As a young man, he received a military training before becoming an ally of more powerful warlords, such as Oda Nobunaga (1534–82)—one of the most brutal leaders of the turbulent Warring States Period  
in Japan—and his successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536–98). Working with Nobunaga and Hideyoshi, Ieyasu not only built  
up large personal landholdings, but he also learned the key values of loyalty and military power that enabled Hideyoshi to bring a brief period of unity to Japan. When Hideyoshi died, Ieyasu rose to the fore. As shogun,  
he was able to impose stability on his country, but he formally abdicated after only two years in favor of his son, Hidetada,  
to secure a smooth succession and establish a pattern of shoguns passing on their office, helping to ensure that the Tokugawa shogunate was long lasting. Although Hidetada had officially become shogun, Ieyasu remained the effective ruler of Japan until his death.

In 1644, the Manchu—a semi-
nomadic people who had built a large state to the northeast of 
China’s Great Wall—seized Beijing from the crumbling Ming regime and established their own dynasty, the Qing, as the rulers of northern China. Seventeen years later, after fierce fighting on an epic scale, the Qing had overcome the determined resistance of Ming loyalists, and extended their power across mainland China. However, their dynasty was still not secure—in 1673, Kangxi, the second emperor, was forced to confront a major uprising, which became known as the Revolt of the Three Feudatories.
The Three Feudatories were 
vast areas of south China that had been granted as semi-independent fiefdoms to three turncoat Ming generals who had assisted the Qing in their conquest of China. Over time, the fiefdoms became increasingly autonomous, but when Kangxi declared that they would not be hereditary, the generals rebelled. The ensuing struggle was hugely costly in terms of loss of life and economic disruption, and for a while, it seemed that one general, Wu Sangui, would topple the Qing. However, he was finally defeated by Kangxi’s supporters, and in 1683, the Qing eliminated the last stronghold of Ming support on Taiwan, which they then occupied.
 With the Qing now undisputed 
rulers of China, Kangxi embarked on military campaigns that added parts of Siberia and Mongolia to  the Chinese empire, and extended its control over Tibet. Under his exceptional leadership, and that  
Qianlong employed  the Italian Jesuit 
Giuseppe Castiglione as court painter, 
and his imperial portraits fused elements of Chinese scroll painting with Western realism and perspective. IN CONTEXT

A global superpower 
During his 61-year reign, Kangxi won the cooperation and loyalty of his native Han Chinese subjects—who had once viewed the Manchu  as barbarians—by preserving and honoring China’s cultural heritage. He also continued the preceeding dynasty’s form of government, and allowed Ming officials to retain their provincial posts alongside Manchu appointees, although the latter supervised most of the work.
Qing China became immensely 
powerful during the reigns of the next two emperors—Yongzheng (1722–35), who also kept a tight control on government and the bureaucracy and increased state revenues by reforming the tax system, and Qianlong (1735–96), under whom the empire’s borders reached their greatest extent and the population boomed. Qianlong was an avid patron of the arts who wrote poetry and sponsored literary projects that enhanced his people’s reputation—although at the same time, he banned or destroyed books that were judged to be anti-Qing.Qing society 
The era of the Three Emperors  was conservative in many ways: Han Chinese men were required  to wear the Manchu hairstyle,  in which the front and sides of  the head were shaved, and the remaining hair plaited into a braid; society was rigidly hierarchical, and there were strict conventions regarding the conduct of women, laws against homosexuality, and censorship. Yet the country’s economy grew substantially in  the early part of the Qing period, thanks to a strong demand in the West for luxury products such as silk, porcelain, and tea. 
However, by the beginning  
of the 19th century, the regime’s repressive treatment of the Han Chinese people, together with famine and widespread addiction to opium—which had been brought into China by European traders— had sent the country into decline. These factors sowed the seeds of rebellions, trading disputes, and wars with European trading partners in the mid-19th century.

Catholic theologian from Spain, founded the Society of Jesus—the Jesuits—with the aim of spreading the faith through the teachings of Jesus. The Catholic Church sent Jesuit missionaries to China during the Ming and early Qing periods, and initially they were welcomed. Kangxi was curious about the Jesuits’ knowledge of science (especially mathematics and astronomy) and technology (particularly the manufacture of weapons and pumps). He appointed Jesuits to the imperial board of astronomy, and it was a Jesuit who made the first accurate map of Beijing. 
Kangxi gave Catholics 
freedom of worship in China, and the Jesuits allowed Chinese converts to continue their rites of ancestor worship (they saw these as commemorations of  
the dead rather than true acts  
of veneration). However, when  
a visiting Vatican envoy ruled  
against the ancestral rites, and the pope followed suit, Kangxi expelled Jesuit missionaries who opposed the practice.By the end of the 19th century, the Qing are a power in name only, 
as the pressures of European imperial expansion and 
growing internal dissent fatally weaken the regime.

Newton published the first edition of his Mathematical 
Principles of Natural Philosophy ,  
or Principia , in 1687. The book 
examines the way objects behave in motion, describes gravity, and explains the movements of planets and satellites. Although it built  on the work of earlier scientists such as Galileo, Huygens, and Kepler, the work was revolutionary. By illustrating how the same  
force—gravity—is responsible for movements both on Earth and in the heavens, it united two scientific realms that had previously been thought separate.
A lasting influence
Newton’s use of mathematics-based theory to explain phenomena was part of a wider scientific revolution. English essayist Francis Bacon insisted that scientists test their observations using reasoned argument, and French philosopher René Descartes championed the use of mathematics and logic to address scientific questions. By emphasizing the importance of human reason, such philosophers broke free from the notion that explanations of  the physical world depended on Christian faith and church doctrine. This paved the way for the intellectual movement called the Enlightenment, and even for the work of later scientists such as Albert Einstein, who modified  and refined Newton’s theories.

Claiming the land for Britain, he named it New South Wales. Working closely with botanists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, he also produced unique records of the indigenous peoples, flora, and fauna. 
An enduring link
Cook’s voyages were part of a wider tradition of European exploration  
of the Pacific by navigators such  
as Dutchman Abel Tasman, after whom Tasmania is named. Cook forged the enduring connection between Australasia and Europe, beginning a process that continued with colonization, the transportation of British convicts into exile, and the founding of cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. 
In his later voyages, Cook used 
the chronometer, newly developed by Englishman John Harrison. It facilitated accurate timekeeping at sea, and so the calculation of precise longitude, which was invaluable to Cook in charting his discoveries.

Having recorded the event, Cook sailed on in search of the rumored “unknown land of the South.” He mapped the New Zealand coast, and then traveled northwest, discovering the eastern coast of Australia in the process. Claiming the land for Britain, he named it New South Wales. Working closely with botanists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, he also produced unique records of the indigenous peoples, flora, and fauna. 
An enduring link
Cook’s voyages were part of a wider tradition of European exploration  
of the Pacific by navigators such  
as Dutchman Abel Tasman, after whom Tasmania is named. Cook forged the enduring connection between Australasia and Europe, beginning a process that continued with colonization, the transportation of British convicts into exile, and the founding of cities such as Sydney and Melbourne. 
In his later voyages, Cook used 
the chronometer, newly developed by Englishman John Harrison. It facilitated accurate timekeeping at sea, and so the calculation of precise longitude, which was invaluable to Cook in charting his discoveries.

minister Cardinal Mazzarin, the 23-year-old Louis XIV 
of France declared that he would now rule alone, as an absolute monarch. During his 72-year reign (1643–1715), Louis dominated his subjects, cultivating the image of  a “Sun King” around whom the country orbited. Louis saw his power as God-given, and himself as the embodiment of the state, with the nobility, the middle classes, and peasants dependent on him for justice and protection. 
To maintain this position, 
Louis controlled the historically unruly aristocracy. He compelled them to attend his court, where he dispensed privileges and positions via a system of etiquette. He filled the treasury’s depleted coffers by appointing members of the upper-middle classes to collect taxes  
in the provinces. Taxation was extensive and the burden fell mainly on the peasantry. Louis’s finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, whose overhaul of France’s trade and industry helped to make the country Europe’s leading power, increased the efficiency of the revenue system.
Expanding France
Louis’s tax income paid for his court at the dazzling Palace of Versailles, an old hunting lodge extended into  a royal palace, and the venue for extravagant entertainments. From 1682 it became the permanent  
base of the royal court, and the seat of government. Louis also waged  a series of costly dynastic wars to make some territorial gains along France’s frontiers, leading the other European nations to form coalitions against him.
Peace was finally achieved at the 
Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, but brought few gains for France. The country was plunged into debt and opinion turned against the Crown. In spite of this, Louis established a pattern of absolutism in France that lasted, in a more enlightened form, for most of the 18th century until attempts to reform the system resulted in the overthrow of the monarchy in 1792 during the French Revolution.

ENCYCLOPÉDIE  (1751)
In the mid 18th century, the 
French philosopher Denis Diderot invited some of his 
country’s leading intellectuals—literary men, scientists, scholars, and philosophers to write articles for a huge “Classified Dictionary  of Sciences, Arts, and Trades,” for which he was both editor-in-chief and contributor. The first volumes of his Encyclopédie  appeared  
in 1751, and the full work was completed 21 years later, made up of 17 volumes of text and another  11 volumes of illustrations.

They sought to apply reason and logic  to explain the phenomena of the natural world, and humankind’s existence, rather than religious  or political dogma. As such, the work challenged both the Catholic Church and the French monarchy, which derived their authority from traditional ideas such as a divinely ordained, unchanging order. 
A revolution in thought
The mission of the Encyclopédie  
was to catalog the collective knowledge of the Western world  
in the spirit of the Enlightenment. This was a multifaceted intellectual movement that took root around 1715, although its origins lay in work done by the pioneers of modern scientific and philosophical thought in the previous century. The work’s multidisciplinary articles, which numbered around 72,000, distilled the ideas and theories of France’s key Enlightenment thinkers—including the writers and philosophers Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Montesquieu. 
The articles were extremely 
wide-ranging, but centered on  three main areas: the need to base society not on faith and the doctrines of the Catholic Church but on rational thought; the importance of observations and experiments in science; and the search for a way of organizing states and governments around natural law and justice. 
Diderot organized the 
Encyclopédie’s articles into three main categories: memory (subjects connected to history); reason (philosophy); and imagination (poetry). Controversially, there was no special category for God or the divine—religion, like magic and superstition, was treated as part  of philosophy. This approach was groundbreaking, and contentious. Religion had been at the very heart of life and thought in Europe for THE EARLY MODERN ERA

In spite of repeated efforts by

Science and reason
The Enlightenment movement  was characterized by a focus on  the power of human reason and skepticism of accepted knowledge. This marked a break from earlier generations in which beliefs about the world derived from religious teachings and the doctrines of the Church.

adherence to a faith. They argued 
that “truths” about the tangible world, which had been set down in antiquity by Aristotle and others, and upheld by the Church, should be tested through experimentation and observation, checked, and then discussed in a rational way.
This radical mode of thinking 
had its origins in the scientific revolution of the 17th century. Scientists and philosophers including Francis Bacon, Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton, and Galileo Galilei had transformed the study  of nature and the physical universe, making it more observational. They conducted careful experiments  and subjected their results to mathematical analysis; in the process they drastically updated and expanded the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, and astronomy. 
Enlightenment scientists took 
this investigation of reality further, making possible, for example, Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus’s development of a proper, rational biological classification in the early 18th century. The inquiring,  reason-based approach of the Enlightenment also triggered dramatic technological advances. In the 1760s, the Scottish physician Joseph Black discovered carbon dioxide, while in 1769, Scotsman DIDEROT PUBLISHES THE ENCYCLOPÉDIE
James Watt made improvements to the steam engine that increased its efficiency, thereby enabling the improvement of factories. The Encyclopédie  helped to publicize 
these, and other, achievements of 18th-century scientists, as well as those of their precursors. 
The work also found an 
audience in the learned societies, academies, and universities that flourished in the Enlightenment period. Although many teachers and scholars at Europe’s older, Church-dominated universities remained deaf to the new scientific way of thought, more progressive ones helped to teach and promote it.
 
Equality and freedom
The scientific revolution and the Enlightenment also encouraged the belief that reason could reveal natural laws in human affairs.Instead of drawing fact from faith, Enlightenment thinkers believed that politics should be separated from religion, that neither should curtail the rights of the individual, and that people should be free to express their opinions, worship in their own way, and read what they want to. This political doctrine, which is often labeled liberalism, had roots in the work of 17th-century philosophers such as Englishman Voltaire 
François-Marie Arouet, who 
chose to be known publicly  
by the name Voltaire, was  
one of the greatest writers  
and social activists of the Enlightenment, renowned  
for his wit and intelligence.  
He was born in Paris in 1694, and spent much of his long life there, although he traveled widely and spoke several languages. He was a hugely prolific writer, producing works in almost every literary genre: novels, plays, poems, essays, historical studies, and philosophical books as well as countless pamphlets. 
Voltaire was an outspoken 
supporter of social reform, including the defense of civil liberties and freedom of religion and speech; he also denounced the hypocrisy of the political and religious establishment. This led to the censorship of some of his work, and also to short spells of imprisonment and periods of exile in England—after which he converted his experiences into an influential book, Philosophical Letters on 
the English —and Geneva, 
Switzerland, where he wrote his most famous work, the philosophical novella Candide . 
Scepticism is the first  
step towards truth.

John Locke—the father of liberalism. 
Locke asserted that there are certain intrinsic human rights that are not dependent on law or custom—in other words, they exist quite separately from what the Church or monarch might decree. These rights could be expressed in different ways, but included the right to life, the right to liberty,  
and the freedom to own what one has produced. These ideas were central to Enlightenment thinkers, following Locke, who felt that such natural rights should form the basis of any system of government. 
Liberal ideas also found 
expression in the work of Enlightenment writers. For example, Voltaire, in books such  as the Philosophical Dictionary,  
highlighted the injustices and abuses of the Catholic Church, and espoused values such as tolerance, freedom of the press, and the promotion of reason over doctrine and religious revelation. In his  Spirit of the Law s, Montesquieu 
advocated the separation of governmental powers (legislature, executive, judiciary) and pressed for an end to slavery. In The Social Contract, Jean-Jacques Rousseau rejected the power of the monarch in favor of that of the people, who, he said, must balance rights with duties, and should be able to decide the laws that govern their lives. The contributors to the Encyclopédie  
also promoted liberal values in economics. They were critical of fairs—where goods were sold by visiting dealers at the expense of local traders, who often had to close their businesses for the duration—and favored markets, which allowed local traders to meet the needs of the local population. 
Ideas such as these spread 
across Europe. Conversations and debates on philosophical, political, and scientific subjects took place in the coffee-houses that had sprung up in English, French, German,  and Dutch cities a century earlier. These coffee-houses now served as information-sharing hubs where men from all walks of life, including writers, politicians, philosophers, and scientists, could congregate  to exchange views. 
Into the light
In Europe, the Enlightenment movement, and the Encyclopédie  
itself, which helped promote its ideals, had a profound impact on social, political, and intellectual  life. Its proponents believed that they were sweeping away an oppressive medieval worldview  and ushering in a new era that they hoped would be characterized by freedom of thought, open-mindedness, and tolerance.
The Enlightenment’s 
questioning, rational approach, and urgent demand for liberty, paved the way for the granting of new civil rights. The movement affected the policies of monarchical rulers, such as the freeing of serfs in the Holy Roman Empire in the 1780s. Monarchs who accepted Enlightenment values took on  the movement’s name, titling THE EARLY MODERN ERA

Enlightenment political philosophy  
began to influence leaders in many parts of the world when they came to draw up legal systems and to establish rights for their citizens—most notably in the fledgling United States, whose Constitution (1789) adopted Montesquieu’s idea of the separation of power into branches of government. 
More generally, the movement 
promoted the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake and recognized that one person’s quest for understanding could benefit the entire human race.

An admirer of Western palaces, 
Peter employed European architects to design the government buildings, palaces, university, and houses in the fashionable baroque style. He also pressed 30,000 peasants each year into construction gangs, along with Russian convict laborers  and Swedish prisoners of war.  
The regimen was strict, and living conditions stark: more than 100,000 workers died, but those who survived could earn their freedom.
The lavish design and vast scale 
of Peter’s architecture showed not only his appreciation of European culture, but also his determination to be an exalted, absolute ruler in the manner of Western despots such as Louis XIV. Peter used his power to make significant changes in IN CONTEXT

an area stretching from Eastern Europe to Siberia that it still

THE FOUNDING OF THE 
SAFAVID DYNASTY, PERSIA
(1501)
The Safavid dynasty rose to power 
under Shah Ismail I, a leader of the Twelver School of Shia Islam, which believes in 12 imams as successors to the prophet Muhammad. In a series of military campaigns lasting until 1509, Shah Ismail conquered Persia (now Iran) and areas of Iraq, in the name of Shia Islam. His  son, Shah Tahmasp (r. 1524–76), defended these lands against the neighboring Ottoman empire, whose rulers followed the opposing Sunni School of Islam. The Safavid dynasty established strong Shia rule in Persia, created an efficient government and bureaucracy, and lasted until 1736. 
CHARLES V BECOMES  
HOLY ROMAN EMPEROR
(1519)
One of the most powerful European monarchs as Hapsburg king of Spain and ruler of Burgundy and the Netherlands, Charles V was elected Holy Roman Emperor in 1519, bringing much of central Europe and northern Italy under his rule. This gave him unprecedented power but also brought challenges from the empire’s neighbors—France on  one flank and the Ottomans on  the other—and from Protestants within his territories. When Charles abdicated, the Spanish crown passed to his son Philip and the title of emperor to his son Ferdinand.THE START OF THE  
DUTCH REVOLT
(1568)
In 1568, the Protestant northern provinces of the Netherlands rebelled against their Catholic ruler, Philip II of Spain, and declared their independence, beginning an 80-year period of war before their Republic was recognized. Philip had imposed his Catholic beliefs uncompromisingly on his Dutch subjects, so many Protestants  from the southern Netherlands, which remained loyal to the crown, moved north. This influx helped  the Republic, which soon grew  into a financially and culturally stable nation thanks to sea trade, scientific progress, and impressive artistic achievements.
THE ST. BARTHOLOMEW’S 
DAY MASSACRE
(1572)
In 16th-century France, violent 
clashes, and, from 1562, civil  war, erupted between Catholics and Protestants. One of the worst episodes took place in 1572, when the Protestant claimant to the French throne, Henry of Navarre, was married in Paris and several thousand Protestants were massacred. After Henry became king of France, he issued the  Edict of Nantes in 1598, ordering religious tolerance. However, the edict was revoked in 1685 by Louis XIV, who ruthlessly oppressed France’s Protestant population; FURTHER EVENTS
HENRY VIII BREAKS  
WITH ROME
(1534)
English king Henry VIII faced a dynastic crisis: he needed a male heir to ensure the succession,  but he and his wife, Catherine of Aragon, were unable to produce one. Henry wanted to divorce Catherine, but the Pope refused him permission to do so. In response, Henry cut off ties with Rome and declared himself head of the church in England. Although under Henry the English church remained largely Catholic in doctrine and practice, the king’s move paved the way  for England’s later acceptance of Protestantism. In addition, Henry dissolved the monasteries, which brought him a new source of land and wealth, and removed a key link with the Roman Catholic church.
CARTIER EXPLORES 
CANADA
(1534–42)
French navigator Jacques Cartier 
explored the northern coast of Canada and Newfoundland, sailing up the St. Lawrence River as far  as what later became Montreal. Although he did not establish a  colony there, Cartier sparked the French interest in Canada, and  his explorations were crucial when French travelers began to found settlements there and make claims on the land in the 17th century. Canada has had a significant French heritage ever since.

under his reign many Protestants were imprisoned and many others fled from the country. 
THE SPANISH ARMADA
(1588)
In 1588, the Catholic monarch Philip II of Spain attempted to conquer Protestant England by sending a fleet of 130 ships to invade the country. After the English succeeded in destroying part of the fleet using fire ships,  a defeat at Gravelines sent the remains of the Spanish Armada retreating northward toward Scotland, where many more ships were wrecked by storms. Only 86 vessels made it back to Spain. The defeat was a blow to Spain, ending this campaign to capture England  for Catholicism and confirming England’s status as a secure Protestant nation under Elizabeth I. 
THE JAPANESE INVASIONS 
OF KOREA ARE DEFEATED
(1592–98)
The Japanese samurai leader 
Toyotomi Hideyoshi launched attempts to conquer Korea in  1592 and 1597, part of a larger campaign that was intended to culminate with an invasion of China. Both times, Japan made major advances, but the Koreans, with the support of Chinese forces, managed to fight back. However, they were unable to expel the Japanese completely, which led  to a stalemate on land, although Korea’s Admiral Yi inflicted frequent naval defeats on Japan. Beaten at sea and confined to  a few fortresses on land, Japan abandoned its attempts to invade. Korea remained independent until 1910, after which there was a 35-year period of Japanese rule. 
THE SIEGE OF DROGHEDA
(1649)
England’s parliamentarian leader Oliver Cromwell launched his campaign to conquer Ireland in 1649, after Irish Catholics took  control of the country from its English administrators in 1641. Once Cromwell had taken Dublin, Drogheda became a base for Irish Catholic leaders. Cromwell laid siege to the town, massacring the people inside its walls when they refused to surrender. Most of the garrison of about 2,500 men,  plus many civilians, were killed. Although the killings did not  break the military code of the  time, their ruthlessness and the sheer number of victims were  both unprecedented, and they embittered future relations between the English and the Irish Catholics. 
THE DUTCH ESTABLISH A 
COLONY AT CAPE TOWN
(1650)
Although Portuguese explorers 
were the first Europeans to  
discover the Cape of Good Hope  
in the 15th century, it was the Dutch who founded Cape Town.  
In 1652, a group from the Dutch East India Company under Jan  
van Riebeeck established a colony there, creating a stopping point  
for Dutch ships on their way to  
and from Asia. The settlement became the center of a large community of people of Dutch origin, who dominated trade and agriculture in the region, evolved their own language—Afrikaans—  
and played a central role in the history of South Africa.
THE OTTOMAN SIEGE  
OF VIENNA
(1683)
By 1683, the Turkish Ottoman Empire was at its greatest extent and included large areas of North Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Austria was on  the empire’s western border, and the Turks had already attempted  to conquer Vienna. In 1683 they besieged the city for the last time: the forces of the Habsburg-ruled Holy Roman Empire and of Poland came to defend Vienna, and the Ottomans were vanquished. From this point on, the Ottomans’ power declined. No longer a threat to Christian Europe, they steadily  lost their European territories.
THE BATTLE OF CULLODEN
(1746)
At the Battle of Culloden, Scotland, an army being led by the Duke of Cumberland, son of the Hanoverian king George II, defeated a smaller force of Jacobites (including many from the Highland clans) under Prince Charles Edward Stuart.  The Stuart prince had hoped to restore his bloodline to the British throne, but Culloden effectively  put an end to his campaign. It  also led to the disarming of the Scottish Highlands, where Jacobite support was strongest, the dismantling of the clan system there, and a ruthless suppression  of Highland culture that included bans on wearing Highland dress and speaking Gaelic.

From the late 18th century, 
history took on a perhaps delusory air of “progress.” 
Change accelerated and seemed  to have a clear direction. The world population exceeded 1 billion in 1804 and was approaching 2 billion by 1914. This growth was made possible by tremendous increases in economic output. Agriculture became more efficient and large areas of new land were put to productive use. The exploitation of new sources of energy—especially steam power—the application of new technology, and organized industrial production in factories revolutionized the manufacture  of commodities. Railways made it possible for humans to travel faster than a horse for the first time and cities expanded—for instance, the population in London increased from 1 million in 1800 to 7 million in 1910. Improvements in public health and medicine increased life expectancy in the most advanced countries.
Human rights and equality
Despite these advancements, it  is debatable whether progress  was detectable in the quality of life.  At the start of this period, political revolutions in America and France enunciated principles of human rights and equal citizenship that radically challenged the existing order of society. By the early 20th century, liberals and democrats in Europe and North America could look with some complacency upon successes such as the widespread expansion of voting rights, the abolition of slavery, and freedom of speech. However, women remained mostly excluded from voting, and there was no economic equality. Extremes of wealth and poverty polarized the world’s wealthiest and most advanced societies, and conditions of life for industrial workers were often very miserable. Artists and intellectuals of the Romantic movement criticized the impact of mechanized industry on people and the environment, while socialist movements looked forward to further revolutions that would end the exploitation of man by man and create egalitarian societies. 
Western imperialism
The most obvious losers in the new world order created by industrial capitalism were the inhabitants of countries at the periphery of the global economy. The industrializing countries of the West, needing places to invest their excess capital, INTRODUCTION

raw materials for their factories, and markets for their new products, found them in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They also sought land for their expanding populations to settle in thinly populated zones such as the North American plains and Australia. Peoples who stood  in their way were swept aside. The Europeans started expanding the areas under their direct rule or control. The British takeover of the Indian subcontinent, more or less complete by the mid-19th century, was the most spectacular example of imperialism in action, and Sub-Saharan Africa was divided among the European powers as if the local population did not exist.
The world’s response to Western 
imperialism was mixed. Resistance was widespread in the form of wars and uprisings against European dominance. On the other hand, the growing superiority of the West in technology, science, military power, and social organization led several non-European governments to try to modernize based on the Western model. In the Muslim world, Egypt, Turkey, and Iran attempted, with only partial success, to pursue a modernizing agenda. In East Asia, Japan successfully transformed itself into an efficient modern state, becoming an imperialist power in its own right. China, by contrast, experienced turmoil and invasion, and imperial rule collapsed in the early 20th century.  
Rising nationalism
Most Europeans and people of European descent gloried in a sense of their own racial and cultural superiority to the rest of the world, but Europe remained a deeply divided continent. Militant nationalism, unleashed by the French Revolution, was a threat to stability. By 1815, the Napoleonic Wars had generated battles of unprecedented scale. After the wars of the mid-19th century  that created a unified Italy and Germany, the great powers maintained large conscript armies and formed mutually hostile alliance systems. These armies were equipped with high-explosive shells and rapid-fire weapons.
European military power, which 
was supported by highly organized state systems and economies, was certainly one of the key elements in European world domination. There would be disaster when European states turned this power against one another.

defeat, in October 1781, the British 
surrendered at Yorktown, Virginia. The war would not formally end for another year, but in every important respect, the colonists—and their French allies—had dealt a huge blow to their British masters.
The French involvement in the 
creation of this new nation owed everything to a desire to reverse the humiliations of the Seven Years’ War. But the debts incurred would, ironically, be among the many causes of the bankruptcy of the French crown that led to the French Revolution in 1789. There was a profound irony, too, in absolutist France seeking to win Americans the freedoms that it was unwilling to accord its own citizens.
Revolutionary ideals
At the heart of the American Revolution was the new political philosophy encapsulated by the Declaration of Independence.  It was the work of a distinctly patrician Virginian, a haughty, wealthy slave-owner named Thomas Jefferson. He was one of  a committee of five charged with writing the Declaration, yet the two drafts it went through in June 1776 were almost entirely his own. It is hard to overstate the importance of the Declaration of Independence. It made, for the time, an astonishing claim: “that all men are created equal.” It further claimed “that governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.”
These were actively seditious 
sentiments that neither George III of England nor Louis XVI of France could have any sympathy with. They nonetheless formed the bedrock of what would become  the United States and, indeed, liberal political systems across  the Western world. These political creeds, derived from the work of THE SIGNING OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
In Declaration of Independence , by 
John Trumbull, the drafting committee 
is shown presenting its work to Congress. Thomas Jefferson can be seen standing in a red waistcoat.
British and French Enlightenment 
thinkers, led to the creation of the first modern state and, in doing so, changed the world.
The destiny of America
Jefferson remains an enigma.  He loathed monarchy yet loved pre-Revolutionary France, where  he was the United States’ first ambassador, delighting in its civilized elegance. He claimed to despise high office yet served two terms as President of the United States. And, as president, in 1803 he drove through the Louisiana Purchase, which saw a vast area west of the Mississippi transferred at a bargain price from France, its nominal ruler, to the United States. 
US_204-207_Dec_Independence.indd   206 15/02/2016   16:43207
He understood that the destiny of the US lay in its colonization of the vast lands to the west, he assented to the notion that its indigenous inhabitants should be driven off, and he owned slaves. “Blacks,” he asserted, “are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.” Whereas George Washington, also a patrician Virginian, freed his slaves, Jefferson opted not to. 
None of this, though, can 
diminish Jefferson’s significance in articulating notions of liberty that resonate today. And even though he felt slavery was wrong, his personal belief was that emancipation would be bad for both slaves and white Americans—unless they were returned to Africa.
A new constitution
Although Jefferson can readily be considered the guiding spirit behind the Declaration of Independence, he played no formal role in the drawing up of the next great document that shaped the nation: its Constitution. The United States was legally able to assert its independence from Britain in 1783. But for the next four years, it existed in an increasingly unstable political vacuum, its fate decided by an ever-more divided Confederation Congress, meeting variously in Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey. 
There were serious reasons to 
believe the new nation might fail, torn apart by those arguing for  the primacy of the rights of the individual states over the central government, and those in favor  of a strong central government or even the creation of an American monarchy. In the spring of 1787, a Constitutional Convention took place in Philadelphia. The written, formalized Constitution proposed would not be provisionally ratified CHANGING SOCIETIES
until June the following year, and then only after prolonged disputes. The result was an assertion of a new form of government. It was both a bill of rights and a blueprint for an ideal government, whose three branches—executive, legislative, and judiciary—would keep each other in check. It would have a profound influence on that issued in Revolutionary France in 1791  and remains a model of its kind. 
“Unfinished business” 
The founding fathers were rightly optimistic about the United States’ potential, but they had failed to resolve one crucial question. Jefferson’s first draft of the Declaration of Independence called slavery “an execrable commerce” and “a cruel war against human nature itself.” However, to placate the slave states of the south and the slave traders of the north, these radical statements were later dropped. Almost 90 years later, it would take a civil war and 620,000 dead to end the practice and complete what Abraham Lincoln saw as the “unfinished business”  
of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.

On July 14, 1789, an enraged 
Parisian mob, seeking weapons to defend their 
city from a rumored royal attack, stormed the crumbling fortress known as the Bastille and murdered its governor and guards. This violent defiance of royal power  has become the symbol of the French Revolution, a movement  that not only engulfed France  but also reverberated around the world. The ideas articulated in the revolution spelled the beginning  of the end for Europe’s absolute monarchies and inspired their eventual replacement by more democratic governments. 
The French Revolution originally 
set out to sweep away aristocratic privilege and establish a new  state based on the Enlightenment principles of liberté , égalité , and 
fraternité . But although it was 
introduced by a surge of optimism,  the revolution soon degenerated into a violence that played out  over several years and that would be brought to an end only by the dictatorship of Napoleon Bonaparte. It remains a story of confusion and chaos, of a collision between a privileged old order, the ancien régime , and a new world that 
struggled, often violently, to  create a coherent new order. 
A country in disarray
The French king, Louis XVI, well meaning but indecisive, was  hardly the man to confront any crisis, let alone one as grave as  that facing France in 1789. In the previous century, his great-great-great-grandfather Louis XIV,  the Sun King, had established France as an absolute monarchy, with all power concentrated in the king’s hands, and his palace at THE STORMING OF THE BASTILLE

Louis XVI thus ruled over a

These desperate summers were followed in 1788–89 by a bitterly harsh winter, leading to mass starvation.

It consisted of clergy, the first estate; nobles, the second; and the commons (essentially a kind of bourgeoisie, lawyers predominating), the third. The States General met at Versailles on May 5, 1789. Almost instantly, the nobles and clerics tried to assert that their votes should be worth more than those of the commons. In response, on June 17, the commons declared itself a National Assembly, vesting power in itself instead of the crown. In August, with peasant uprisings across rural France, the Assembly abolished feudal taxes and aristocratic privileges and issued what it called the Declaration of the Rights of Man, a statement asserting fundamental freedoms.
In October 1789, events were 
suddenly accelerated when a vast crowd, outraged by the lack of bread in Paris, descended on Versailles and forcibly removed the royal family to Paris, ransacking the palace for good measure.

It had been comparatively easy 
to overthrow the existing royal government, but it would prove infinitely harder to establish a new government. It was presumed that

abandoned hope of reasserting his 
authority. Large numbers of French aristocrats—emigrés—had already fled France, fearing the revolution had made it unsafe. In trying to persuade other European regimes—  
Austria above all, whose emperor was the brother of the French queen Marie-Antoinette—they stirred up opposition to the revolution, but their principal impact was to reinforce a determination in France to see the revolution succeed.
In June 1791, Louis attempted to 
escape, but was intercepted near the border with the Low Countries and brought back to Paris to the jeers of the increasingly violent, politicized common folk, the sans-culottes, their name a reference to their striped, baggy trousers. There was an increasingly hostile stand-off between political factions in Paris, such as the Girondins and more extremist Jacobins, which attracted the support of the sans-culottes,  
and the French government.
An external threat
Whatever the obvious instability, progress toward a new social order was being made. In September 1791, a constitutional monarchy was proclaimed. Similarly, the church’s privileged position was forcibly ended, though this, too, provoked lasting upheaval and violence. Equally critically, the freedom of  the press was asserted. 
At the same time, revolutionary 
France faced an external threat from Austria and Prussia, both determined to reassert the primacy of hereditary monarchy and to forestall revolutionary tendencies  in their own countries. In April 1792, France declared war on both, a war that would continue, in different guises, for 23 years. By August, the combined Austrian and Prussian forces were within 100 miles (160km) of Paris.
A kind of hysteria gripped the 
city. A mob stormed the Tuileries, where the royal family was held, slaughtering its Swiss Guards. The following month, a further round of killings, the September Massacres, was unleashed against anyone suspected of royalist sympathies. September 1792 also marked the establishment of the directly elected National Convention and of the First French Republic. Almost THE STORMING OF THE BASTILLE
Louis XVI was executed in 1793. 
Using the guillotine as the only means of execution for all people—royals and paupers alike—was meant to reinforce the revolutionary principle of equality.its first act was to put Louis XVI on 
trial as a traitor. In January 1793, he was executed, an early victim of the guillotine, championed as a humane and egalitarian means of death.
The sense of crisis continued to 
grow. In April 1793, the Committee of Public Safety was created to safe-guard the revolution. For a year or more, under the chairmanship of  
a provincial lawyer, Maximilien Robespierre, the most influential  
of the now-dominant Jacobins,  
it would effectively become the government of France. Its impact  
on France, however short-lived, was devastating. This was the Terror. Counter-revolutionary movements across the country were ruthlessly suppressed, most obviously in the Vendée region of the southwest, where up to 300,000 died. Churches proved particularly rich targets. The Terror’s victims were less likely to be remaining aristocrats and more anyone Robespierre suspected of impure thoughts, including almost all of his political opponents.So, legislators, place Terror  
on the order of the day!…  
The blade of the law should 
hover over all the guilty.

Security, September 1793

Robespierre’s single-minded pursuit of revolutionary purity reached an improbable climax with his creation in 1794 of a new religion, the Cult of the Supreme Being. It was intended as a focus of, and spur to, patriotic and revolutionary virtues, the superstition of the Catholic Church replaced by a belief dedicated to reason celebrating the natural laws of the universe. The megalomania it suggested contributed significantly to his sudden downfall, and at the end of July 1794, Robespierre was put to the guillotine.
Order restored
With the end of the killings—more particularly with the establishment of yet another government, the Directory, at the end of 1795—order of a sort was restored. Tellingly,  it was achieved in part by the Directory’s willingness to use force against the Paris mob, ordered by Napoleon Bonaparte, then a young general in the revolutionary army. 
Furthermore, France’s armies, 
boosted by mass conscription, were reversing early defeats, apparently poised to carry the revolution into new territories. Emboldened, France reinforced its assertion of what it claimed were its “natural frontiers” on the Rhine, which in reality meant an audacious extension of French rule into Germany. By 1797, it had inflicted crushing defeats over Austria in the Low Countries and in northern Italy. France was ready to re-assert what it saw as  
its natural primacy in Europe.
Historical significance
Whatever the importance of the French Revolution, it remains the subject of continuing and intense historical debate. Its notional goals were clear: the ending of repressive monarchy and entrenched privilege; the establishment of representative government; and the championing of universal rights. But the reality was confused and often violent. 
Furthermore, by 1804 Napoleon 
had effectively swapped one form  of absolutism for his own, albeit one vastly more effective than any France had known since Louis XIV. Yet the revolution’s consequences reverberated well into the 20th century. It remains a pivotal moment in the belief that freedom should underpin the civilized world.

Maximilien 
Robespierre
Robespierre (1758–94), a 
lawyer and a member of the third estate in 1789, was  
the chief architect of the Terror that gripped France between September 1793 and July 1794. He was a consistent champion of the dispossessed, as well as a remarkable orator, capable of astonishingly intense speeches that electrified his supporters and opponents alike. He was also a fierce opponent of the Revolutionary Wars, believing that a strengthened army risked becoming a source of counter-revolutionary fervor. Initially, at least, he was also opposed to the death penalty. His change of mind was startlingly absolute. When persuaded that terror was  
the most effective means  
of preserving the revolution,  
he embraced it implacably, arguing that it was the natural handmaiden of the virtue  
he felt should drive the revolution. He remains the original, chilling model for  
all those who have since championed state violence in the interests of a supposed greater good.The French Revolution set out with the idea of building  
a new state that would take the Enlightenment principles  of liberty, equality, and brotherhood as its foundation.

Robespierre’s single-minded pursuit 
of revolutionary purity reached an improbable climax with his creation in 1794 of a new religion, the Cult of the Supreme Being. It was intended as a focus of, and spur to, patriotic and revolutionary virtues, the superstition of the Catholic Church replaced by a belief dedicated to reason celebrating the natural laws of the universe. The megalomania it suggested contributed significantly to his sudden downfall, and at the end of July 1794, Robespierre was put to the guillotine.
Order restored
With the end of the killings—more particularly with the establishment of yet another government, the Directory, at the end of 1795—order of a sort was restored. Tellingly,  it was achieved in part by the Directory’s willingness to use force against the Paris mob, ordered by Napoleon Bonaparte, then a young general in the revolutionary army. 
Furthermore, France’s armies, 
boosted by mass conscription, were reversing early defeats, apparently poised to carry the revolution into new territories. Emboldened, France reinforced its assertion of what it claimed were its “natural frontiers” on the Rhine, which in reality meant an audacious extension of French rule into Germany. By 1797, it had inflicted crushing defeats over Austria in the Low Countries and in northern Italy. France was ready to re-assert what it saw as  
its natural primacy in Europe.
Historical significance
Whatever the importance of the French Revolution, it remains the subject of continuing and intense historical debate. Its notional goals were clear: the ending of repressive monarchy and entrenched privilege; the establishment of representative government; and the championing of universal rights. But the reality was confused and often violent. 
Furthermore, by 1804 Napoleon 
had effectively swapped one form  of absolutism for his own, albeit one vastly more effective than any France had known since Louis XIV. Yet the revolution’s consequences reverberated well into the 20th century. It remains a pivotal moment in the belief that freedom should underpin the civilized world.

Maximilien 
Robespierre
Robespierre (1758–94), a 
lawyer and a member of the third estate in 1789, was  
the chief architect of the Terror that gripped France between September 1793 and July 1794. He was a consistent champion of the dispossessed, as well as a remarkable orator, capable of astonishingly intense speeches that electrified his supporters and opponents alike. He was also a fierce opponent of the Revolutionary Wars, believing that a strengthened army risked becoming a source of counter-revolutionary fervor. Initially, at least, he was also opposed to the death penalty. His change of mind was startlingly absolute. When persuaded that terror was  
the most effective means  
of preserving the revolution,  
he embraced it implacably, arguing that it was the natural handmaiden of the virtue  
he felt should drive the revolution. He remains the original, chilling model for  
all those who have since championed state violence in the interests of a supposed greater good.The French Revolution set out with the idea of building  
a new state that would take the Enlightenment principles  of liberty, equality, and brotherhood as its foundation.

A continent reshaped
During the Revolutionary Wars, France had established sister republics in northern Italy and the Low Countries; under Napoleon, many of these were reformed into kingdoms, whose monarchs came from the Emperor’s family. States across Germany were carved up, at the expense of Prussia, to become a French puppet state, while the 800-year-old Holy Roman Empire was abolished. From 1807, much of Poland was controlled by the French as the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. These were states recast on French lines: clerical power was reduced, serfdom abolished, and aristocratic privilege ended. But such reforms provoked inevitable resentments.
Napoleon’s conquests were the 
result not just of military genius  but also of greatly enlarged French armies. Conscription, introduced  in 1793, swelled the French army from 160,000 men to 1.5 million. Only Britain, protected by the English Channel, remained undefeated, its position as the world’s leading maritime power underscored by victory at Trafalgar, off southern Spain, in 1805. But maritime muscle alone was not enough to beat Napoleon. Britain’s most significant role was financing the endlessly shifting alliances confronting the French.
In response, Napoleon imposed 
the Continental System, which forbade trade between continental Europe and Britain. However, Portugal and Russia continued  to trade with Britain, prompting Napoleonic invasions in 1807  and 1812 respectively. 
Resistance to Napoleonic rule 
was mounting; the Spanish began a brutal guerrilla war that drained French resources and came to be referred to by Napoleon as the “Spanish ulcer.”

Napoleon had bred a sense of French invincibility, and this made his eventual defeat all the more traumatic for the nation. Of the 450,000 men he led against Russia in 1812, barely 40,000 survived. 
Napoleon had overreached 
himself. At Leipzig, Germany, in 1813, outnumbered three to one by forces from Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Sweden, he suffered his first major defeat. By Waterloo, his forces had recovered slightly, and the ratio was only two to one, but Napoleon’s military genius failed to redress the balance and his imperial ambition ended in the Waterloo mud.

moment in the emergence of an independent Latin America. 
By 1825, the continent had 
successfully ended almost 300 years of Spanish and Portuguese rule. In Brazil, which won its independence in 1822, the process was relatively easy and also largely bloodless.

Simón Bolívar 
Born in Caracas, Venezuela,  
in 1783, Simón Bolívar came 
from one of the oldest and wealthiest noble families in the city. His education was completed in Europe, where he absorbed the republican ideals of the American and French revolutions. The idea  
of independence for Hispanic America accordingly took  
root in his imagination. 
His revolutionary career 
began with an abortive uprising in Caracas in 1810. In 1814, the charismatic Bolívar declared himself “liberator” and head of state of the new republic of Venezuela. In 1817, he staged a daring invasion  
of Colombia and went on to complete the conquests of Ecuador and Peru in 1824. Bolívar’s dream was to unite all of South America—except Argentina, Brazil, and Chile—  
in a single great republic. However, his dictatorial tendencies and the brutality  
of his armies eventually led  
to dissent and the fracturing of Gran Colombia in 1830,  
the year of his death.Indians, black people, and those of 
mixed race—that were never likely to produce coherent political wholes. Plagued by bitter disputes, the short-lived republic of Gran Colombia would break up in 1830. 
Brazilian independence 
Though partly influenced by the liberal doctrines of the American and French revolutions, the drive  
to independence in South America was seldom the product of a desire for social justice or representative government. Aside from two abortive Mexican revolutions in 1810 and 1813, it was a struggle for supremacy between ruling elites, none of which had much interest in the kind of social change—society recast on liberal principles—that underpinned the French Revolution. That said, this drive was also significantly affected by the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon’s invasion of Portugal in 1807 forced the Portuguese king, João VI, and his court to flee to safety in its Brazilian colony. João remained there even after the fall of Napoleon in 1815, returning to Portugal only in 1821. However, his son and heir, Pedro, stayed in Brazil.
As in Spain’s Latin American 
colonies, Brazil was dominated by  a land-owning elite, a great many  of whom, over many generations, had been born in South America.

They came to resent the fact that 
ultimate authority was exercised  by a distant monarchy, and saw no reason why they should submit to it.
There are clear parallels with 
the American Revolution. But  while in North America it was  the fundamental liberties of free-born men that were disputed, in Brazil the issue was narrower— it was simply a question of who would govern.
In 1822, to protect the interests 
of the native-born elite, Pedro declared Brazil an independent constitutional monarchy and himself its emperor. This was a revolution only in the sense that it produced Brazilian independence  
in the interests of those already ruling it. One of the more obvious consequences was that, with no change to the social or economic order, slavery remained legal  in Brazil until 1888, later than anywhere else in the Western world.
Governing Spain’s colonies
In Spain’s colonies, the drive for independence stemmed partly  from the desire of the native-born ruling class—the creoles—to assert their interests, not least in the face of Spain’s restrictive control of South American trade and punitive taxation policies, both to the disadvantage of the colonies. In  the short term, however, it was a reaction to Napoleon’s invasion of Spain in 1808 and his deposition of the Spanish king, Ferdinand VII, in favor of Napoleon’s brother, Joseph. In effect, Spain’s colonies no longer had a legitimate ruler of their own, so it was their plain duty to become rulers themselves, at least until the monarchy could be restored. 
While South American liberals 
saw Joseph as the harbinger of a new, more just social order in place of the absolutism of Ferdinand VII, monarchists in the colonies saw any such liberalizing tendencies  as inherently destabilizing. The seeds of internal conflict were being sown. 
Social revolution in Mexico
At the time, Mexico, which was known as the Vice-Royalty of  New Spain, encompassed an immense area that extended  almost from present-day Wyoming to Panama and that included  most of Texas. Events there took  a different turn. In 1810, a priest, BOLÍVAR ESTABLISHES GRAN COLOMBIA
Pedro I of Brazil , whose coronation  
is illustrated in this painting by 
Jean-Baptiste Debret, was the son  of the king of Portugal. He had been  left in Brazil to rule as regent.
Miguel Hidalgo, appalled at the 
obvious inequalities of Mexico,  led a popular revolution that  ended the following year in its brutal suppression and Hidalgo’s execution. Another popular uprising led by a second Catholic priest, José Morelos, between  1813 and 1815 was similarly put down. When, in 1821, Mexico  did gain independence, it was by force against more or less token Spanish resistance, and under the leadership of Augustín de Iturbide, a Mexican general who proclaimed himself emperor of Mexico the following year. His rule lasted less than a year. By 1838, Mexico had lost all its Central American territories, and by 1848, it had lost all its North American territories.

Events in Spanish South America—which included the triple Vice-Royalties of New Granada, Peru, and Rio de la Plata—followed a very different course. The key figure here was Simón Bolívar. Born in modern-

aristocratic, and highly educated. He had visited Europe several times and was an enthusiastic supporter of modern nation-building on the model established by the French Revolution. He believed, in particular, that the diverse peoples and interests of South America could be brought together by the assertion of a shared South American identity, expressed by the creation of a vast new South American state. This was to be Gran Colombia, which embraced an immense area of northern South America, essentially the modern states of Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, and Panama.
Bolívar’s vision of an 
independent South America consistently fell foul of a series  of political realities. His military successes—for example, in 1824, the routing of the remaining Spanish strongholds in Peru,  when his armies attacked from  the north and the south in a pincer movement in the Central Andes—proved impossible to translate into enduring and stable states. 
Bolívar was an idealist and  
a passionate opponent of slavery.  He considered that so disparate  a land and a people could only  be ruled by a strong central government. Seeing himself as  its natural leader, he proposed himself as the lifelong president  of Gran Colombia. This provoked predictably bitter opposition.
Gran Colombia breaks up
By 1830—the year Bolívar died, aged 47, of tuberculosis—Gran Colombia had already broken up. Arguably, it was the result of  the kind of nationalism already surfacing in Europe, with the independence of Greece and, the following year, of Belgium. More particularly, it was due to a failure  
to agree on the future of Gran Colombia. There were disputes  over whether its government  was to be liberal, conservative,  or authoritarian. Venezuela, in particular, was subjected to bitter wars throughout the 19th century that cost the lives of an estimated 1 million people.CHANGING SOCIETIES
This lack of direction resulted in instability and a social inequality that would persist for a century  or more. It would also produce a series of authoritarian military leaders acting in the interests of the landowners. An inevitable consequence was a persistently oppressed underclass, urban  and agricultural, black and  white. The hacienda —vast acres 
inefficiently worked by armies  of peasants in the interests of a complacently cruel, land-owning elite—dominated. 
In 1910, Mexico descended into 
another revolution. This was partly a result of being wrenched between ineffectual liberal regimes that sought to alleviate the obvious suffering of the poor but did little  to address fundamental economic weaknesses and self-serving authoritarian regimes that cared more for bombast than real reform.
Bolívar’s visions of a recast, 
independent South America could never contend with the reality of  an unequal society that shared no common belief in its own destiny and that was consistently the victim of competing, mostly violent efforts to assert special interests.

On September 15, 1830, the 
world’s first commercial passenger rail service to 
be powered by a steam engine—George Stephenson’s Rocket — 
was opened. This was the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, which was 35 miles (56km) long and  served by locomotives, also designed by Stephenson, that  
were capable of reaching speeds approaching 30 mph (48km/h). 
Stephenson’s Rocket  symbolized 
what remains the key development in world history over the past  250 years: the transformation from  an agricultural society that relied on windmills, watermills, horses, and other beasts of burden, to an industrial one, in which steam engines were capable of generating reliable power on a scale that was previously unimaginable.
The background
The industrialization process that started in Britain around the mid- to late 18th century was initiated  by the scientific revolution in Europe in the late 17th century. Of similar importance were financial changes pioneered in the Netherlands, then STEPHENSON’S ROCKET  ENTERS SERVICE

The Industrial Revolution
BEFORE
1776  Adam Smith’s The 
Wealth of Nations  is published.
1781  Watts’s first rotating 
steam engine is invented; the world’s first iron bridge is built at Coalbrookdale, England.
1805  The Grand Junction 
Canal, between Birmingham 
and London, is completed.
1825  The world’s first 
commercial steam-powered 
railway, linking Stockton and Darlington, opens.
AFTER
1855  The Bessemer furnace  
is introduced.
1869  The first transcontinental 
railroad is completed in the US.1885  The first practical petrol- 
driven internal-combustion 
engine is installed in a motor vehicle, in Germany. A scientific revolution  in the West creates a sense that the 
world can be better understood  and better exploited .
The development of steam-powered machinery encourages

The West imposes itself across the rest of the globe,

imported to Britain: more readily 
available credit helped boost entrepreneurial activities. It had never been easier for members of the increasingly wealthy middle class, looking for ways to invest their money, to support new inventions and technologies.
A third factor was an agricultural 
revolution, which began in the Netherlands and Britain, where farmers realized that crop rotation made it unnecessary to leave land fallow every third year. In both of these countries, land reclamation increased the acreage available  
US_220-225_Stephensons-Rocket.indd   222 15/02/2016   16:43223
for farming. Crop yields were thus boosted, just as selective breeding produced larger and more profitable domesticated animals—sources  of food and wool alike. With any likelihood of famine now receding, the population of Britain grew, between 1750 and 1800, from 6.5 million to over 9 million. This,  in turn, meant new markets and  an expanded workforce.
Finally, in Britain, an improved 
transport network allowed goods, produced on an ever-larger scale,  to be transported faster and more reliably. Between 1760 and 1800,  as many as 4,250 miles (6,840km)  of canals were built in England. 
Thinkers sought to understand 
the impulses behind these societal changes. The publication in 1776  of The Wealth of Nations by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith underpinned what was becoming known as political economy, and the central role of the profit motive and of competition in increasing efficiencies and lowering prices.
This economic transformation  
also contributed to and was, in turn, boosted by the emergence  of global markets—a consequence  of burgeoning European colonial empires, which offered greater  access to raw materials and also provided markets for finished goods. A better-mapped world,  and improvements in ship  types and position-finding at  sea, also facilitated global trade.
Steam power
The overriding force behind the economic transformation, though, was the development of the steam engine. In an astonishingly short time, it would revolutionize Britain, making it the world’s first industrial power, and ultimately transform the world. Even so, it might never have had its dramatic global impact had Britain not had huge reserves of the fuel needed to make it work: coal.  The replacement of wood as the prime source of fuel was critical to industrial development. In exactly the same way, the development of coke (processed coal that burns at much higher temperatures than coal) at the beginning of the 18th century would make the production of iron—the indispensable core material of the new technologies—faster and simpler.
Steam engines of varying 
degrees of reliability had been developed as early as 1712, when Thomas Newcomen built an “atmospheric engine.” But it was only with James Watts’s first rotating steam engine in 1781 that the extraordinary potential of machine

power became clear. The earliest 
steam engines had been used mainly as pumps. Watts’s rotating engine, on the other hand, could power machinery. The engineering company he and Matthew Boulton established in Birmingham in 1775 produced over 500 steam engines.
When Watts’s patents expired  
in 1800, others started producing their own steam engines. The textile industries in the northwest benefited in particular from the increased availability of steam power, and large-scale, almost entirely mechanized, factory production soon replaced small, home-based manufacturing. By 1835, there were more than 120,000 power looms in textile mills. No longer dependent on rivers as power sources, factories could be built anywhere, and they came to be concentrated in towns in the north and Midlands of England that rapidly grew into major industrial centers as the century progressed. 
Social changes
Huge numbers of workers were drawn to these new cities, which became synonymous with poor living and working conditions for the workforce, many of whom were children. This influx led to the creation of an urban underclass. It took a long time before the workers saw any improvement in their lives, and the realization that they should share in the rewards of this social and economic transformation, rather than simply be exploited as mere drudges, came very slowly. In the meantime, however, the increasingly wealthy factory owners emerged as a significant political voice.
The wider world
As late as 1860, Britain was, by some way, still the world’s leading industrial and mercantile power, but other Western nations were quick to see how they too could benefit. In continental Europe, industrialization was initially uncertain, inhibited by the kind of political instability Britain had managed to avoid, such as the revolutions of 1848. Later, the pace of its development would rival Britain’s. In 1840, Germany and France each had around 300 miles (480km) of railway lines; in 1870, both had 10,000 miles (16,000km). Similarly, pig-iron output from each rose from about 125,000 tons in 1840 to 1 million in 1870.STEPHENSON’S ROCKET  ENTERS SERVICE
However, the most startling developments came in the United States, where there were around 3,300 miles (5,300km) of railway  in 1840, almost all in the northeast. By 1860, this had increased to 32,000 miles (51,500km), and by 1900 it had soared to 193,000 miles 
Isambard Kingdom 
BrunelNo figure better encapsulates  
the determination, ambition, and 
vision that drove the first phase of the Industrial Revolution in Britain than the prodigiously hard-working Isambard Kingdom Brunel (1806–59). He was responsible for an extraordinary series of firsts: the world’s longest bridge (the Clifton Suspension Bridge), the world’s longest tunnel (Box Tunnel in Wiltshire), and the world’s largest ship (the Great Eastern ). In 1827, still only 21, he 
was appointed chief engineer of the Thames Tunnel. In 1833, he became engineer to the newly formed Great Western Railway, which by 1841 linked London directly with Bristol, whose docks he had rebuilt from 1832. Believing it should be possible to travel directly from London to New York, Brunel also designed the world’s first practical ocean-  
going steamship, the Great Western . He followed this with 
the screw-driven iron-built Great Britain . Despite his great vision, 
delays and cost overruns dogged many of Brunel’s projects, but his works include some of the grandest feats of engineering the world had yet seen.The Bessemer process , devised by 
the English engineer of the same name 
to convert iron into steel, improved the efficiency of all industries—from transport to the military. 
US_220-225_Stephensons-Rocket.indd   224 15/02/2016   16:43225
(310,600km) of rail track. The 
production of pig iron rose similarly: in 1810, it was a little less than 100,000 tons a year; in 1850, it was approaching 700,000 tons; in 1900, it was over 13 million. 
The role of steel
By about 1870, in both Europe  and the United States, a second wave of industrialization began,  in which oil, chemicals, electricity, and steel became increasingly important. The production of steel had been transformed after 1855, when English engineer Henry Bessemer devised a way to make the metal lighter, stronger, and more versatile; from that point forward, steel would prove the linchpin for industry. In 1870,  total world steel production was 540,000 tons, but within  25 years it had risen to 14 million tons, and railways, armament production, and the shipbuilding industry all benefited from its  ready availability.
While Germany was beginning 
to threaten Britain’s industrial preeminent position in Europe, quadrupling its industrial output between 1870 and 1914, the United States was rapidly becoming the world’s largest industrial power.  In 1880, Britain was still producing  more steel than the United States, but by 1900 the United States was producing more steel than Britain and Germany together.
At the same time, steam-
powered ships were also being introduced. Sailing times, no longer dependent on the vagaries of the wind, became more controllable, and journey times were shortened. The ships were significantly larger, too. While the largest wooden ships rarely exceeded 200ft (60m) in length, the Great Eastern , launched 
in 1858, was 689ft (210m) long. Total world steamship tonnage in 1870 was 1.4 million. By 1910, it  had reached 19 million.
Winners and losers
The benefits of industrialization were unevenly spread. Southern Europe was slow to react to it, and Russia also struggled to catch up. The Chinese and Indian empires proved unwilling or unable to industrialize, Latin America did so only intermittently, and Africa  was dominated by technologically superior powers. By contrast,  after 1868, Japan’s single-minded pursuit of industrialization made  it a world power. 
Industrialization also made 
possible a new kind of warfare, one capable of bringing death on a scale CHANGING SOCIETIES
never seen before. An enduring irony of industrialization is that the nations that benefited most from it turned it against themselves in two world wars, deploying weapons of extraordinarily destructive power.
The Industrial Revolution laid 
the foundations for the modern world. Fueled by an enormous sense of new possibilities, in  some places it raised living standards across all sections of society in ways unimaginable  in earlier ages. However, in the wealthy West, it also produced  a sense that material superiority was equivalent to a kind of moral superiority, one that not merely made it possible for the West to dominate the world, but demanded that it do so.

 THE SLAVE TRADE ABOLITION ACT (1807)
The passing in 1807 of the 
Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves in the United 
States and the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act in Britain marked  
a radical shift in Western thinking. Even as late as the 1780s, the trade in slaves was still regarded as a “natural” economic activity. Both the newly created United States, “conceived in liberty,” and the European colonies in the Caribbean depended on slave labor that was relatively easily obtained in West Africa. Portuguese-ruled Brazil was even more dependent on slaves.

position. Not only had slavery never 
been legal there—a point critically reinforced in 1772 in what was called the Somersett case, which ruled that any slave was free once on British soil—but Britons prided themselves on their robust defense of such fundamental freedoms. Even so, Britain was also, by  some margin, the West’s leading slave-trading nation. It was this contradiction that offended both religious and Enlightenment political sensibilities alike.
Global changes
To a number of high-minded and unusually active campaigners  such as William Wilberforce and Thomas Clarkson, the abolition of slavery became an imperative. A remarkably effective campaign was launched that, despite entrenched opposition, rapidly won wide public and parliamentary support. For much of the 19th century, the Royal Navy would be at the forefront of the campaign to intercept those still engaged in slave trading. 
While Britain took the lead,  
the movement had important supporters elsewhere. The revolutionary French National Convention outlawed slavery in 1794 (though this would partially  be overturned by Napoleon in 1802). Brazil aside, where slavery would not be banned until 1888, all the newly independent states that emerged in Latin America after 1810 likewise outlawed slavery.
It wasn’t until 1833 that slavery 
itself, as opposed to the trade, was made illegal in the British Empire. Whatever the efforts of a new set of campaigners, not least Elizabeth Heyrick, the motive was not entirely humanitarian. The Haitian slave revolt, which began in 1791 and led to the emergence of an independent Haiti in 1804, had left the West uncomfortably aware that any such uprisings might prove difficult to suppress. A slave revolt in British-ruled Jamaica in 1831 reinforced the point: in the longer term, freeing slaves might prove less trouble than enslaving them.
The United States, forward-
looking and expansive, remained the great troubling sore. The more abolitionists in its industrializing northern states denounced slavery, the more its southern states, their agrarian economies dependent on slave labor, were determined to retain it. It would take a four-year civil war and 670,000 dead to  settle the question. 
■The Haitian Revolt
Few uprisings illustrate the 
contradictions of the revolutions that swept across the late 18th- century Western world better than that in Haiti (1791–1804). This French Caribbean colony, known as St. Domingue, owed its enormous prosperity to slave labor. The revolt, led by a freed slave, Toussaint L’Ouverture, was inspired by the American and French revolutions. Yet neither country supported it:  
The US was concerned it might inspire similar revolts in its slave states; France, despite its pledge to abolish slavery, was wary of the damage to its trade. Spain, which ruled the eastern half of the island, also opposed it, as did Britain, fearing it would spread to its own colonies. Even the South American colonies seeking independence refused to back it, fearful of its impact among their substantial slave populations. Yet the occasional combined resources of all these states were unable to quell the uprising. This was the only slave revolt to result in the emergence of an independent state.The state of slavery is 
repugnant to the principles of 
the British constitution and  
of the Christian religion.

 SOCIETY WAS CUT IN TWO
 THE 1848 REVOLUTIONS 
On February 24, 1848, Louis-
Philippe of France, the “Citizen King,” abdicated 
as Paris erupted in protest at the government’s refusals to initiate  reforms—demanded by the middle and working classes alike—to introduce political liberalization and to end inequalities. In his place, a Second Republic was declared. In June, fearful that one authoritarian government had  been exchanged for another, the Parisian working classes rose  again, but the uprising was savagely put down. In December, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte—nephew  of Napoleon, who had died in  1821—was elected president. In 1851, he staged a coup, and the following year he was proclaimed  
as Emperor Napoleon III.
France was plagued by political 
instability throughout the 19th century. The 1848 revolution came after a similar upheaval in 1830, and it would be followed by an  even more violent uprising 23 years later, in 1871. 
The spark for the revolution  
of 1848 was a famine during  
the previous two winters. This provoked widespread unrest  
among the dispossessed urban poor, along with demands from a burgeoning bourgeoisie for liberal political reforms. The ardor of  
the revolution sparked similar revolts across continental Europe, most obviously in the German Confederation, in multi-ethnic Austria, and in Italy. Every single revolt was subdued, in most instances by force.
The rise of socialism
Before and after the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815, and concerned about citizens rising up elsewhere, Europe’s statesmen met in Vienna to try to create a political order that would stifle such an occurrence.

The ceremonial opening, on 
November 17, 1869, of the Suez Canal, linking the 
Mediterranean and the Red seas, was an emphatic declaration of European—specifically, French – technological and financial  means. It was also a significant illustration of a rapidly emerging and increasingly interdependent global economy, featuring goods from all parts of the world being traded on an ever-larger scale.  This was a process dominated by Europe’s colonial powers and the United States, overwhelmingly its  principal beneficiaries. It was simultaneously a further boost  to Europe’s imperial ambitions.
The Suez Canal reduced the 
sailing route between London and Bombay by 41 percent, and the route between London and Hong Kong by 26 percent. The impact  on trade was plain to see. However, reduced sailing times also greatly simplified the defense of India and its crucial markets, Britain’s key imperial goal. By the end of the 19th century, trade in the Indian Ocean, protected by no fewer than 21 Royal Navy bases, had become THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SUEZ CANAL

It, too, dramatically reduced sailing times, shortening the Liverpool to San Francisco route by 42 percent, and the New York to San Francisco route by 60 percent.
US involvement
The fact that the United States  took over the construction of the Panama Canal underlines a crucial shift in US attitudes: they were committing not just to expanding trade but also to advancing US overseas interests. This had begun in 1898, when the US itself became a colonial power, taking over the Philippines from Spain.

the same spirit. A remarkable  
4,600 miles (7,400km) long and spanning seven time zones, it remains the longest continuous railway in the world. It played a key role not just in the settlement of Russia’s vast Siberian territories, but in Russia’s encroachment on parts of northern China, too. 
The impact of the telegraph  
was just as significant, allowing messages to be communicated along electrical lines. Samuel Morse devised the system in the United States in the 1830s, and the first telegraph line was inaugurated in May 1844. Within a decade, there were 20,000 miles (32,200km)  of telegraph cable in the US. 
The first telegraph cable across 
the Atlantic, laid in 1858, worked for only two weeks. But by 1866, a new cable had been installed, capable of transmitting 120 words per minute. By 1870, a telegraph link had been established between London and Bombay; this was then extended to Australia in 1872 and New Zealand in 1876. By 1902, the United States was linked to Hawaii. This was the first near-instant international communications system.The Great Eastern
The ship responsible for laying the transatlantic cable in 1866 was the Great Eastern , designed by the 
most visionary engineer of the  first phase of the Industrial Revolution, Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Designed to carry 4,000 passengers from England to Australia non-stop (and to return  to England without refueling),  the ship was overly ambitious in concept and a commercial failure. 
However, it was indicative  
of a trend toward larger, faster,  and safer ships. Unlike the Great Eastern , which was built of iron, 
later, steel-built, propeller-driven ships would prove more versatile. Their introduction coincided with the development of more powerful and efficient steam engines.
Steamships and trade
The decline of the sailing ship further transformed imperial  trade. One notable result was  the introduction of a series of  ever-larger passenger ships. The transatlantic route saw the most obvious developments. In 1874, the British steamer Britannic , capable 
of generating 5,500 horsepower,  set a new east–west Atlantic  record of just under eight days.  In 1909, the Mauretania , which 
generated 70,000 horsepower and carried over 2,000 passengers,  set a new record of four days  and 10 hours, cruising at an average speed of 26 knots, or  30mph (48km/h).
New types of merchant ships— 
mainly refrigerated vessels—were also being built. Such developments show how technology helped drive trade, making it possible to reach global markets. The cattle and sheep farms in South America (especially Argentina), Australia, and New Zealand were growing  THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SUEZ CANAL
The RMS Mauretania , built at 
Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, UK, was the 
largest and fastest ship in the world.  In 1909, it set a record, sailing across the Atlantic in less than five days. in size in line with their own 
populations. At the same time,  the number of people in Europe was also increasing—for example, Britain swelled from 28 million  to 35 million between 1850 and 1880. Feeding and clothing the populations were important priorities. Wool could be easily transported, but lamb and beef could not be shipped because it would rot en route—until 1877, when 80 tons of frozen beef  were shipped from Argentina to France on board the world’s first refrigerated ship. By 1881, regular shipments of frozen meat were traveling between Australia and Britain. The first shipment of  lamb from New Zealand was made the following year. There was a  vast increase in the export of  meat from all three countries— New Zealand, for example, exported 2.3 million frozen sheep  in 1895, 3.3 million in 1900, and 5.8 million in 1910.
The demand for cotton—above 
all in the great textile mills of the northwest of England, which by 1850 were producing up to 50 percent  
of the world’s cloth—led to an enormous surge in cotton growing. In the southern states of the US, raw cotton production increased from Although gold and silver are

However, the ploy failed, since Britain merely increased its imports of raw cotton from India. After weaving the cotton, it then exported it back to India at substantial profits.Global finance
This complex trading network could not have grown without developments in banking and financing. Throughout the late  
19th century, new banks were established, their capital used  
to support enterprises across  
the world. At the same time, London emerged as the world’s financial capital. By the end of  CHANGING SOCIETIES
the 19th century, the British  
pound sterling, its value pegged  
at 113 grains of gold, was the currency against which all others were measured. 
Western overseas investments 
dramatically increased. By 1914, the United States had overseas assets worth $3.5 billion, Germany $6 billion, France $8 billion, and Britain almost $20 billion. Between them, North America and northern Europe’s share of world income  in 1860 was about $4.3 billion a year, 35 percent of the world’s  total. In 1914, it was $18.5 billion,  60 percent of the world’s total. 
Patterns of imperialism varied 
over the 19th century. In the  British Empire, for example, clear and increasing distinctions were drawn between those colonies—  
in Africa and Asia, above all—whose native populations were governed by Europeans, and  
those—such as Canada, South Africa, Australia, and New  
Zealand—deemed capable of  
self-government. By 1907, all four had been granted dominion status. It was not a privilege extended  to a single British African colony  or to India.

The Great Mineral Rush
The search for new sources of 
minerals, both precious and industrial, reached new heights toward the close of the 19th century. Discoveries of diamonds and gold in the US, Canada, Australia, and—most significantly of all—South Africa sparked a frenzy of development. Diamonds were discovered in South Africa’s Orange Free State in 1867, and gold in the Transvaal in 1886. Both were independent Boer republics, established by the descendants of the original  Dutch settlers of what had become the British Cape Colony. Their heightened economic importance reinforced Britain’s determination to annex them, which they could do only after  
the bitter Boer War (1899– 1902), which stretched Britain’s military resources to their  limits. The exploitation, both before and after the conflict,  
of the mineral resources of  what in 1910 became the Union  
of South Africa by armies of underpaid black workers would later prove to be critical in the institutionalizing of Apartheid.
Working conditions in South 
Africa’s gold mines were harsh, and the work force—mainly young black men—was exploited and underpaid. The Suez Canal greatly shortened travel times—  
and eased journeys—between parts of the  British Empire, such  as England and India.  That distance of 10,800 nautical miles was  cut by more than  40 percent, to just  6,200 nautical miles.

scientist of the 19th century, Charles Darwin originally 
intended to follow his father into medicine and was subsequently sent to Cambridge to train as an Anglican cleric. Endlessly curious, he was interested in almost any scientific question.The publication of his book On the Origin of Species (1859) introduced a new scientific understanding of what gradually came to be known as evolution. In the book, Darwin asked a fundamental question. The world teems with plant and animal life: where and what had it come from? How had it been created?IN CONTEXT

Darwin was far from the first to 
propose that a process of change over vast periods had produced this diversity, but he was the first to suggest an explanatory theme, which he called “natural selection”. 
Natural selection
At the heart of Darwin’s idea was his contention that all animal life was derived from a single, common ancestor—that the ancestors of all mammals, humans included, for example, were fish. And in a natural world that was never less than relentlessly violent, only those most able to adapt would survive, in the process evolving into new species.
These views were largely formed 
by the around-the-world voyage he made as the naturalist on the British survey vessel HMS Beagle  between 
1831 and 1836, most of it spent in South America. It would take him 10 years to work up his voluminous notes and to go through all the samples he collected on his voyage. 
Darwin’s book inevitably 
generated controversy, outraging Christian views that the world had been created intact and unchanging by a benevolent deity. Yet however heated the initial debate, quite rapidly there was widespread acceptance of Darwin’s views and a realization that he had made  a decisive contribution to the understanding of the world. In  the process, the status of science generally was immensely boosted. 
The primacy of science
Despite everything, it was possible for Darwinism to be warped. What came to be called “the survival of the fittest” would later prove to be influential in justifying imperialism, racism, and eugenics. 
On the Origin of Species was 
published at a time when a growing understanding of the natural world and rapid technological progress meant scientific study had a greater practical worth than ever before. Darwin was one of the last amateur gentleman scientists in a discipline that was becoming professionalized as society came to view science more highly. Partly as a result of Darwin’s work, but also because of these changing attitudes, science began to have a more central place in public life.

 THE EXPEDITION OF THE THOUSAND  (1860)
On May 11, 1860, the Italian 
patriot and guerrilla fighter Giuseppe Garibaldi landed 
in Sicily, then part of the Bourbon-ruled Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, in southern Italy, leading a force of volunteers drawn from across Italy and just over 1,000 strong, hence their name, I Mille  (The Thousand). 
Their goal was to overthrow the Bourbons, but there was much uncertainty as to what government would replace the ruling family.

Reaching a compromise
In 1859, much of Italy had already been united under the state of Piedmont-Sardinia, in the northwest of Italy, a process directed by its shrewd and pragmatic prime minister Camillo Cavour and critically boosted by French military assistance in expelling  the Austrians. 
For Cavour, unification meant

Nationalism was furthermore 
characterized by a romantic view  
of the right of peoples to lay claim to their historic destinies and rule themselves: independence. In place of loyalty to an established ruling dynasty, new loyalties to national groups defined by language, culture, history, and self-identity were formulated. The idea of the nation-state became increasingly common, and likewise a belief in the right to national self-determination.
The failure of the revolutions  
of 1848 in central Europe and Italy, intended to advance these very goals, made plain the resolve of Europe’s ruling elites to oppose such initiatives and to preserve the Europe created by the Congress  of Vienna in 1814–15, after the defeat of Napoleon—a Europe of monarchs, multinational empires, and pre-French Revolution frontiers. 
Metternich’s failures
The new Europe was far from stable, and the principal architect of the Congress of Vienna, the Austrian Prince Metternich, would later admit: “I have spent my life in shoring up rotten buildings.” By 1830, Belgium had revolted against the Kingdom of the Netherlands, of which it was a province; the next year, it secured its independence with British support. Similar nationalist uprisings followed in Poland in 1831 and in 1846, both savagely repressed by Russia.
German nationalism 
Rising nationalism had momentous consequences, especially in the various states across Germany.  
The country’s unification under  
the chancellorship of Otto von Bismarck of Prussia in 1871 and  
the declaration of a German empire jolted Europe into a new era. For Bismarck, much as they had been for Cavour, the benefits of unification were clear. It would be the means  
by which a common German nationality could be expressed, allowing the country to fill the need to underline an overarching German character that the philosopher Georg Hegel had identified. It  would also break the dominance of Habsburg Austria over the German-speaking world—in particular,  
to lever the southern Catholic German states, Bavaria above all, away from Austrian influence.
In the interests of building this 
great German state, Bismarck pressed into service a kind of conservative nationalism. The goal was not social or democratic reform to establish a more just or liberal state; it was the creation of a country to challenge the world. German nationalism under Bismarck translated into a determined adoption of industrialization and the creation of ever larger and more efficient armed forces.
And it was military means that 
Bismarck single-mindedly deployed to create this new Germany. He mounted three major campaigns. The first, against Denmark in  1864, saw Prussia subsuming  the southern Danish territories  THE EXPEDITION OF THE THOUSAND

of Schleswig and Holstein, with 
Austrian support. In 1866, Prussian troops routed Austria itself; finally, in 1870–71, an army from across Germany comprehensively and humiliatingly defeated France, toppling Napoleon III’s government, and starving Paris into submission. These military victories underlined a seemingly irresistible German destiny whose logical consequence was a unified German empire under the Prussian king, now emperor, Wilhelm I.
Nationalist aspirations
Nowhere were the conflicting impulses of nationalism more tangled than in the Habsburg Austrian Empire, an immense patchwork of ethnic groups across Central Europe under the nominal rule of Vienna. In 1867, following Austria’s defeat by Prussia the previous year, Hungary was  able to secure almost complete independence from Austria. The “dual-monarchy” that resulted— the Austrian Empire, now the Austro-Hungarian Empire—not

only greatly boosted an assertive 
sense of Hungarian self-identity but also secured Hungary significant territorial concessions from Vienna, notably in Transylvania and Croatia. Yet whatever the continuing tensions between Austria and Hungary, the two warily preferred  
to remain united precisely for fear  
of further nationalist agitations  
from their own splintered ethnic populations. The Hungarians, for example, were notably reluctant to concede the kind of political rights they demanded for themselves to their substantial Slovak, Romanian, and Serb populations. At the same time, waning Ottoman control of the Balkans also encouraged nationalist aspirations—Serbia, for example, had emerged as a more or less independent state as early as 1817. Wallachia and Moldavia, essentially modern Romania, could lay similar claims to independence by 1829. The Greeks, portraying themselves as the legatees of ancient Greek civilization, a role that won them support from liberals across Europe, had secured their independence by 1830 after a nine-year war. 
Both Austria and Russia 
competed to fill the void left by the Ottomans. Austria’s provocative occupation of Bosnia in 1878, which it peremptorily annexed in 1908, would create tensions that led directly to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. The Balkan Wars of 1912–13—in effect a bitter squabble for supremacy between Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece—were further evidence of the destabilizing effect of nationalist-driven state building.CHANGING SOCIETIES
The consequences 
The notion that social justice could be secured by peoples pursuing the right to self-determination would rarely be realized in the 1800s—Vienna would continue to rule over its multi-ethnic empire until its defeat at the end of World War I  in 1918, for example. Likewise,  the people of Poland were  
denied any means of exercising such nationalistic rights to self-determination. And the Jews of Europe remained persistently oppressed, whatever the promise of Zionism from the 1890s to create a Jewish nation in the Holy Land.

which took place between May and November 1857, 
led to scenes that were duplicated across much of north-central  India during the Indian Mutiny  of 1857–58: of British enclaves enduring great suffering at the hands of previously loyal local troops. When the British began to restore order, the retribution was no less severe. The violence from both sides shocked the public and led to immediate calls for reform.
The mutiny began when the 
Indian troops—sepoys—became convinced that the cartridges of their new rifles had been greased with cow and pig fat, offensive to Hindus and Muslims alike. But  its roots lay in the dislocation  that many in India felt at British control—the uprooting of traditional rulers, the apparent threat to local religions, and the aggressive assertion of alien rule.
Britain’s initial response after 
the mutiny was intended to reassure India of Britain’s peaceful intentions toward it, but in reality  it underlined the fact that India was now entirely subservient to Britain, both economically and politically.
As the number of European-
educated Indian elites grew, they would challenge Britain’s rights over the subcontinent. Britain would continue to assert its imperial destiny, but increasingly had to confront the improbability that it could. If there was an enduring truth, it was that British rule in India was never as robust as it seemed.

 THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS (1863)
On November 19, 1863,  
little more than halfway through the American Civil 
War, in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, US President Abraham Lincoln gave what came to be known as the Gettysburg Address. In it, he characterized the Civil War as a struggle both for national unity and to guarantee equality for all people.
Lincoln was talking at the 
dedication of the Soldiers’ National Cemetery, which commemorated the 7,058 soldiers killed at the Battle of Gettysburg, an encounter fought between July 1–3, the same year that had left 27,224 more wounded. Gettysburg had been the bloodiest battle of the American Civil War, as IN CONTEXT

The causes of the war
The American Civil War was not simply a war about slavery; it was  
a war about whether so divisive an issue could be allowed to break up the United States. The United States, as Lincoln said, was a nation “conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,” yet its Southern states had a population of almost 4 million black slaves. Under the constitution of the United States, they were legally owned property. For the abolitionists of the rapidly industrializing north—always  
a minority, but still exceedingly vocal—slavery was morally repugnant and an outrage against their Christian sensibilities. 
However, slavery was not just 
the backbone of the agricultural prosperity of the Southern states;  CHANGING SOCIETIES
The Battle of Gettysburg took place 
in 1863. After three days of fighting  and the death of more than 7,000 soldiers, the Confederate army was forced to retreat.
Abraham Lincoln When he arrived in Washington in 
February 1861 for his presidential inauguration, Abraham Lincoln (1809–65) was widely dismissed  
in political circles as an ignorant, socially awkward backwoodsman. By the time of his assassination just four years later, he had come to dominate America. Lincoln  
had not just won the Civil War, but he had also established himself as a kind of irresistible political oracle. 
Born in a log cabin in Kentucky, 
Lincoln qualified as a lawyer  
by his late 20s. He became an increasingly articulate champion of what would emerge as the anti-slavery Republican party. Despite having no military experience, Lincoln proved  
an increasingly shrewd judge  
of how the Civil War should  
best be fought, actively arguing in favor of General Grant.  
He never lost sight of his  
wider aims: the maintenance  
of American liberties and the essential dignity of humanity. He pushed on with the war  
with unflinching determination, yet he understood precisely what loss of life on the scale  
of the Civil War meant.for slave-owning Southerners, it 
was a right. For them, “liberty” had an additional meaning: the liberty to possess slaves.
The disagreement underlined 
the question over States’ Rights—the extent to which the rights of individual states trumped the authority of the federal, or central, government in Washington. This question repeatedly resurfaced as territories in the west were settled and sought admission to the Union: would they be slave or “free” states?
The 1820 Missouri Compromise 
stated that slavery would be allowed only in new states south of a line extending westward from the southern border of Missouri. It  
was later agreed that the settlers  
of new states should decide for themselves whether theirs would be free or slave states—a decision that was reinforced by the

Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. Since 
both Kansas and Nebraska were to the north of Missouri’s southern border, what followed, in Kansas above all, was a sudden inrush of pro- and anti-slavery settlers, each desperate to prevail. The two sides clashed repeatedly and violently.
The South breaks away
This conflict led to the founding  of a new anti-slavery party, the Republicans, on whose ticket Abraham Lincoln, with practically no support from any slave state, was voted into office in November 1860. Lincoln’s victory prompted the almost immediate decision by South Carolina to secede, to leave the Union. By February, a further six Southern states had broken away, and the seven declared themselves a new nation: the Confederate States of America. By May, when Richmond in Virginia was made the capital of the new country, four more states had joined them. However, five slave states, the so-called Border States, opted to remain within the original Union.
The Confederacy argued that 
the Constitution had been freely adopted, and as such any state could legitimately break away  from the Union if it felt oppressed. As free-born men, the citizens of the South had an “inalienable” right to shape their own destinies, just as the founding fathers had when they rejected the tyranny of British rule. In the minds of many Southerners, the US government was guilty of precisely the same kind of tyranny in seeking to limit these freedoms.
It was a deeply held position. As 
Alexander Stephens, vice-president of the Confederacy, asserted, the cornerstone of this new state “rest[ed] upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery… is his natural and normal condition…”.THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS
As a supreme political operator, Lincoln realized the need to proceed with caution. Initially at any rate, his position was that he sought only to restrict the expansion of slavery while preserving the Union. On  
the second point, Lincoln was immovable; he felt the authority of the federal government overrode that of individual states.
The United States, the only  
fully democratic country on Earth, had been created as what Lincoln called “a great promise to the world,” so ensuring its survival was an absolute moral duty. By the time of his Emancipation Proclamation The United States is born as a beacon of liberty  
in which slavery  is nonetheless permitted.
The industrial Northern 
states  are opposed  to any 
extension of slavery into 
any new states.
The Gettysburg Address is Lincoln’s most 
eloquent attempt to justify the war as the 
means to a more just United States.The Southern states  
increasingly see slavery  
as a key part of their  
agrarian society .
These differences of opinion help spark the Civil War ,  
bringing destruction on an unforeseen scale , with neither  
the North nor the South able to best the other.
The South’s defeat  results in political paralysis   
and institutionalized discrimination  against its  
black population that persists well into the next century .

my home, my children.

politically secure enough to order the freeing of all Southern slaves. But in the short term, the Civil War was fought to keep this “great promise” intact.
Eventual Northern victory
The outcome of the American Civil War was dictated ultimately by the human and material discrepancies between the North and the South. There were 21 Union states with  a population of 20 million, and 11 Southern states with a population  of 9 million, 4 million of whom were slaves, and therefore not allowed  to bear arms. Despite the fact that by 1864, 44 percent of males in the North between the ages of 18 and 60 were in military service, versus 90 percent in the Southern states, the North was still able to enlist 2.2 million men over the whole war, compared to the South’s 800,000. 
The North was three times 
richer than the South. It had 2.4 miles (3.8km) of railroad to every  
1 mile (1.6km) in the South. Its factories manufactured 10 times more goods. It produced 20 times more iron than the South, 38 times as much coal, and 32 times as many firearms. The only area in which the South exceeded the North was in cotton production, at 24 to 1.
In the face of this superiority,  
the fact that the South was not only able to resist the Union forces for four years but also to come close  
to victory in 1862 and 1863 was a reflection of the Southern soldiers’ profound belief in their cause. It was also the result of its plainly superior generals—the Virginian Robert E. Lee above all. By contrast, at least until the emergence of Ulysses S. Grant and William Sherman as the two leading commanders of the Union forces, the North had been able to muster only a succession  
of timid and inept generals who frittered away the advantages they so abundantly possessed.
Reinvigorated by Grant and 
Sherman, the North prevailed. The razing of Atlanta in September 1864 was followed by Sherman’s “march to the sea” at Savannah, Georgia. Completed in December, it left a 60-mile- (96.5-km-) wide swathe of destruction, deliberately targeting

civilian property. “War is cruelty,” Sherman asserted. “The crueler it is, the sooner it will be over.”
A new freedom
The US Civil War was the world’s first major industrial war, the first to make widespread use of railroads, and the first widely reported in a new kind of popular press. There was concentrated death on a scale never seen before: around 670,000 dead, 50,000 of them civilians, in little more than four years. 
For Abraham Lincoln, the war 
represented what in the Gettysburg Address he called “unfinished business.” The Constitution had  left unresolved the question of  how slavery could exist in a nation “conceived in liberty.” Despite the destruction and the huge death  toll, the war brought a chance  
at “a new birth of freedom.” The  
end of slavery, confirmed by  
the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, represented an opportunity for the US to be recast as a genuinely free land for all its citizens, black and white.

The belief by sometime

of the United States lay in its expansion to the west was boosted immensely by the discovery of  
gold in a river in northern California in January 1848. Even allowing  
for the inevitable difficulties of communication and travel at the time, the find sparked a frenzied reaction. Over the next five years,  
as many as 300,000 “49ers”—a reference to the year in which the influx began in earnest—were drawn to what, in 1850, would become the 31st state of the US. The immediate consequence was both a wild lawlessness in the pursuit of instant riches and the confirmation of America’s Pacific coast as a promised land. The

Gold was behind the most

The US government authorized the settlement of the Black Hills of South Dakota after gold was discovered there. By doing so, however, it broke a treaty with the Sioux of the Great Plains. When, in return, substantial numbers of Sioux and Cheyenne refused to move to reservations, federal cavalry were sent to Montana to round them up. Among them was a troop of 600 under Lieutenant Colonel George Custer. Some 200 of these men, led by Custer himself, discovered the Indian encampment in the Little Bighorn Valley. In just one hour, the combined American Indian warriors, led by Sitting Bull, killed Custer’s entire force.

By 1861, it was 31 million; and by the turn of the century, 76 million. There were inevitable costs to  such rapid growth, and American Indians paid the highest price. Driven off their tribal lands with relentless brutality, their numbers dropped from perhaps as many as 4.5 million to 500,000. Herded into reservations, their traditional way of life destroyed, they were helpless in the face of this seemingly irresistible expansion.

 THE OPENING OF ELLIS ISLAND (1892) 
By the mid-19th century, the 
world was experiencing an unprecedented boom in 
population, particularly in Europe. This increase would continue into the 20th century and beyond. It  was partly due to improvements  in health, backed by more ready access to food as a consequence  of improved agricultural methods. It was also a result of industrialization and urban growth, as well as the affluence and improved living standards that both produced. Political stability played a role, too. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Europe enjoyed almost 100 years of largely unbroken peace.IN CONTEXT

Nature also had a hand in the 
increase in migration. The Irish potato famine of the 1840s, resulting from a failed crop, may have been the last major European famine, but it brought suffering on a startling scale: up to 1 million people died. It provoked among survivors a vast wave of emigration of over 1 million, almost all to the US. The population of Ireland in 1841 was 6.5 million; by 1871, it had dipped to 4 million.

Industrialization produced a similar paradox. Whatever the civic pride and bombast of the immense new urban centers of the Industrial Revolution, especially in Britain, a new urban underclass was being created, desperately impoverished and living in extreme squalor.
For the citizens of continental 
Europe, the lure of new lands in which to be free and prosper would prove irresistible. Substantial numbers of Germans, Czechs, and Hungarians left central Europe after the suppression of the nationalist revolts of 1848. From 1870, huge numbers of Russian and Polish Jews—1.5 million in 1901–10  alone—similarly emigrated,  fleeing anti-Semitic pogroms. 
The numbers involved in this 
huge transfer of populations were remarkable. From the mid-19th century to 1924, 18 million people emigrated from Britain, 9.5 million from Italy, mostly from its deprived south, 8 million from Russia, 5 million from Austria-Hungary, and 4.5 million from Germany. Between 1820 and 1920, the US attracted 33.6 million immigrants, where  
they often found themselves in  
poor living conditions in rapidly expanding cities such as Chicago and New York, aiding the growth  
of American industry with their cheap labor. Over the same period, 3.6 million Europeans settled in South America, and 2 million in Australia and New Zealand. 
Unwelcome guests
This process of relocation was  not exclusively European. Indians settled in South Africa, Chinese migrants spread across the East Indies, and Japanese migrants settled in California; many found themselves unwelcome.
There were also victims of 
enforced emigration. Unknown numbers of black African slaves were still being shipped around  the world. 
By 1910, more than one in seven 
of the US population had been born outside of the United States.

Ellis Island
Opened on January 1, 1892, Ellis 
Island, along with the Statue of Liberty, became a symbol of the vast stream of immigrants that poured into the United States.  
This immigration center processed perhaps 12 million people, and  
it is claimed that as much as  
40 percent of the immigrant population of the United States has at least one relative who  
was fed through this immense bureaucratic machine. Built on nothing more than a nondescript sandy island, close to the New Jersey shore in New York Harbor, Ellis Island had at its heart a vast, echoing hall. Here, shuffling forward, the newly arrived immigrants, speaking  
a dazzling array of languages, would be processed. They were examined medically before being subjected to a series of simple questions to establish their eligibility. The great majority would then become accepted as citizens of the United States, with scarcely 2 percent turned away. Ellis Island finally closed its doors  
on November 12, 1954.
In its first 30 years , Ellis Island 
saw 80 percent of United States’ 
immigrants passing through—almost 12 million people. I had always hoped that  
this land might become a safe 
and agreeable asylum to the 
virtuous and persecuted part 
of mankind, to whatever 
nation they might belong.

 THE MEIJI RESTORATION (1868)
The overthrow in 1868 of  
the Tokugawa shogunate, 
rulers of Japan for 250 
years, was led by feudal barons from the southern provinces of Choshu and Satsuma and was the direct consequence of its weakness in the face of aggressive demands by the United States, Britain, Russia, and the Netherlands to establish trading links. In place of the shoguns, the pliant 14-year-old Meiji emperor would “exercise supreme authority.” The goal of the barons was not to take over and maintain Japan as it had existed under the shogunate—  
rigidly hierarchical and deliberately isolated from the wider world. IN CONTEXT

Japan transformed
There followed a transformation of  a kind no society had seen before or has seen since. Modeling itself on the West, in 30 years Japan became one of the most dynamic industrial powers in the world and the leading military power in East Asia.
Almost no aspect of Japanese 
society was left untouched by this whirlwind of change. In 1871, Japan abolished feudalism and established the yen as its currency. By 1872, the first railway was under construction; within 15 years, there was 1,000 miles (1,600km) of track. In 1873, Japan introduced conscription,  along with Western weapons and uniforms. The same year saw an overhaul of the education system, and in 1877 Japan’s first university was established in Tokyo. Japan also introduced a new legal code in 1882, and a new constitution seven years later. As industry boomed,  so exports grew. Cities similarly expanded, as did the population, swelling from 39.5 million in 1888 to 55 million by 1918.The spur to modernization had largely been the fear that Japan, like China, would become another Western colonial pawn. In fact, the opposite occurred. 
Military expansion
By the 1890s, Japan was a colonial power. In 1894, Korea had asked both Japan and China to help curb an insurrection there. When both countries later sought to take over Korea, the Japanese swept the Chinese aside, and then demanded and received possession of Taiwan, as well as rights in Manchuria. Here they came into conflict with Russia. The Japanese victory in 1905 over a disorganized Russian fleet at the Battle of Tsushima Strait was the first time an industrial European power had been defeated by an Asian power. Japan had the world’s attention.

of Meiji in January 1868, the emperors of Japan were little  
more than a symbol. Under the shogunate, they were obliged  
to remain invisibly at the royal palace in Kyoto more or less permanently. Strictly speaking, the “restoration” never happened: Meiji had already become emperor in February 1867, following the sudden death of his father, Emperor Komei. 
For those ambitious daimyo , 
or feudal barons, who were determined to drive Japan into the modern world, elevating  
the emperor to a higher profile bestowed legitimacy on what was otherwise an act of usurpation. It is telling that one of their first acts was to force the emperor to move to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo in 1868, the former residence of the shogun. Meiji himself remained an impenetrable cypher to the end.

 THE SECOND OPIUM WAR (1856–1860)
On October 6, 1860, after 
years of sporadic conflict known as the Second 
Opium War, an Anglo-French force seized the imperial capital of Peking (today Beijing), in China, to force  
the Chinese to submit to trading concessions. The point was underlined when the Europeans burned down the emperor’s sumptuous Summer Palace. The Chinese agreed to talks, and the resulting Peking Convention not only increased the number of Treaty Ports open to Western trade, but British and French zones of influence were extended in south China and along the fertile Yangtze River.

Less than 70 years before, Britain 
had sent an embassy to China to open trade talks, only to be rebuffed. Late 18th-century Qing China was the richest, most populous, and most powerful country in the world, and it could afford its complacency.  
By the mid-19th century, however, the nation was effectively bankrupt, racked by famines and revolts,  
and increasingly exploited and humiliated by the West.
Uprisings and revolts
China’s problems were internal  as much as external. A swelling population—100 million in 1650, 300 million in 1800, 450 million  in 1850—provoked recurring famines. Between 1787 and 1813, there were three major uprisings. Its border provinces, conquered  at huge expense in the 17th and 18th centuries, were in a near-permanent state of unrest. 
In 1850, the Taiping Rebellion 
erupted across central China, resulting in the death of as many  as 20 million people. When it was finally put down, in 1864, it was only after Western intervention. The Qing dynasty, its administration increasingly ineffective, had essentially lost control of China.
The West intrudes
It was this growing turmoil that  the West exploited, weakening China further in the process. The first, modest trading concessions China had agreed to stipulated that all Chinese goods be paid for in silver. However, from the early  19th century, European traders, mostly by bribing officials, were increasingly able to use opium, cheaply grown in India, to pay for goods. By the 1820s, 5,000 chests of opium a year were entering China. 
The Chinese attempt to end  
the opium trade and its debilitating effects led to a crushing defeat in the First Opium War of 1839–42, with the European powers, Britain above all, extracting substantial trading concessions. It was Western insistence in 1856 that these concessions be extended  that led to the Second Opium War, concluded in 1860 by the Peking Convention. By 1900, a string  of Western trading ports were scattered along the Chinese coast. Britain, France, Japan, and Russia now all controlled what had been Chinese tributary states on its borders. China, wracked by turmoil, was effectively disintegrating.

The Boxer Rebellion
In the turmoil of late 19th-
century China, it was inevitable that efforts would be mounted to end the growing dominance of the West. The imperial government in Beijing made a last-ditch attempt at reform on Western lines, but the chaos came to a head in 1899 with the Boxer Rebellion, mounted by the Militia United in Righteousness, a semi-secret society composed mostly of young men. Its goal,  
to be achieved in part thanks to their deluded belief that they were invulnerable to Western weapons, was the overthrow  
of all Western interests.  
The rebellion was variously supported and opposed by  
the imperial court, uncertain whether it represented a means of salvation or would merely provoke Western reprisals.  
The latter proved to be the  
case. An eight-nation military alliance, including Japan,  
was sent into China against  
the Boxers, and by September 1901 the rebellion had been crushed, amid scenes of indiscriminate violence.

I OUGHT TO BE JEALOUS  
 OF THE EIFFEL TOWER.  
 SHE IS MORE FAMOUS  
 THAN I AM
 THE OPENING OF THE EIFFEL TOWER (1889)
The opening of the Eiffel 
Tower on March 31, 1889 was a startling assertion  
of Parisian bombast in the years between the humiliations of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–71 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914. This was the Belle Epoque,  a time when Paris could—and  did—confidently proclaim itself  the City of Light, supremely cosmopolitan, the art capital of the world, and the epicenter of civilized living. Paris was the city reborn, and over it now soared Gustave Eiffel’s tower, at 984ft (300m) not just the tallest structure in the world, but a triumphant monument to technological progress.
The ideal city
Modern Paris was the creation of Napoleon III. Beginning in 1853, the French emperor had whole districts knocked down, replacing medieval buildings and tangles of tiny streets with imposingly vast boulevards. It was urban planning on a scale never seen before. Train stations were built, water supplies improved, sewers constructed, parks laid out, and stunning vistas created. The goal was a model  city, one that would reflect not  just the glory of France but also  its mastery of the modern age.
It was a process mirrored in 
cities across the industrial West.  In 1850, there were three European cities with populations larger than 500,000: Paris, London, and Constantinople. Fifty years later, there were nine with populations larger than 1 million, and by  1900, London was the largest  city in the world, with 6.5 million inhabitants. The same dizzying growth occurred in the US,  
The Eiffel Tower was erected in  
time for the Universal Exposition of 1889. At the time, it was the world’s tallest structure. It has since come to represent Paris to the entire world. IN CONTEXT

too—between 1850 and 1900, the 
population of Chicago, for example, tripled, from 560,000 to 1.7 million.
Difficulties and inventions 
The initial consequence of this population explosion was quite staggering urban squalor. Diseases such as cholera and typhoid were commonplace. It became clear that the infrastructure demanded by any modern city had to include not just adequate public transport and well-lit streets, for example, but major improvements in public health—above all, sanitation.
The shift in the quality of life  
in these great metropolises was extraordinary. It was paralleled  by the rapid development of  mass consumerism, the direct consequence of improved living standards, shorter working hours, and compulsory education, with basic literacy and numeracy now increasingly commonplace. It was an age of music halls and popular theater, and subsequently of the cinema; of the phonograph; of mass-circulation newspapers; and of a growing interest in sports. 
Just as central to this age of 
growing affluence and increased leisure—at least for some—were the first department stores. These were a conspicuous part of a retail revolution that was coupled, from the 1870s, with an advertising explosion, with color posters mass-  
produced for the first time. And from the 1890s in the United States, cityscapes were further changed by a new type of building: skyscrapers. Just as the Eiffel Tower before them, they rapidly became symbols of the transformation in urban life. 
■Underground railways
Between 1800 and 1900, the 
population density in New York rose from 39,183 per square mile to 90,366, and  
the congestion was worsening as public transportation took up valuable land. A solution favored in the United States was an elevated railway— a train line raised above  
the streets on steel girders. The first was opened in New York in 1868. 
In the UK, the same space 
constraints led to the birth

too—between 1850 and 1900, the 
population of Chicago, for example, tripled, from 560,000 to 1.7 million.
Difficulties and inventions 
The initial consequence of this population explosion was quite staggering urban squalor. Diseases such as cholera and typhoid were commonplace. It became clear that the infrastructure demanded by any modern city had to include not just adequate public transport and well-lit streets, for example, but major improvements in public health—above all, sanitation.
The shift in the quality of life  
in these great metropolises was extraordinary. It was paralleled  by the rapid development of  mass consumerism, the direct consequence of improved living standards, shorter working hours, and compulsory education, with basic literacy and numeracy now increasingly commonplace. It was an age of music halls and popular theater, and subsequently of the cinema; of the phonograph; of mass-circulation newspapers; and of a growing interest in sports. 
Just as central to this age of 
growing affluence and increased leisure—at least for some—were the first department stores. These were a conspicuous part of a retail revolution that was coupled, from the 1870s, with an advertising explosion, with color posters mass-  
produced for the first time. And from the 1890s in the United States, cityscapes were further changed by a new type of building: skyscrapers. Just as the Eiffel Tower before them, they rapidly became symbols of the transformation in urban life. 
■Underground railways
Between 1800 and 1900, the 
population density in New York rose from 39,183 per square mile to 90,366, and  
the congestion was worsening as public transportation took up valuable land. A solution favored in the United States was an elevated railway— a train line raised above  
the streets on steel girders. The first was opened in New York in 1868. 
In the UK, the same space 
constraints led to the birth  
of the underground railway.  
The first, using conventional steam engines, was London’s Metropolitan Railway, which opened in 1863 and linked Paddington and King’s Cross stations with the City of London.

 THE BERLIN CONFERENCE (1884)
The Berlin Conference  
did not precipitate the sudden European takeover 
of Africa after 1880 but, rather, confirmed Europe’s self-asserted right to impose itself on a continent deemed backward, ignorant,  and savage. Called by Otto von Bismarck, Germany’s chancellor, the conference was held over the winter of 1884–85 and attended by representatives from 14 countries. It was intended in part to legitimize a more or less enforced subjection of Africa and, by setting agreed rules of colonization, to avoid conflict between Europe’s colonial powers, France and Britain most obviously.

The European takeover
Before colonization, Africa possessed a variety of states and territories, some quite precisely defined, some amorphously tribal—there was  an extreme contrast between  the sophistication of Egypt, for example, and the Congo in tropical Africa. At the same time, much of the north was Muslim. The first European holdings in Africa were coastal trading forts, sustained  by gold and the slave trade. The interior remained impenetrable, but as it was revealed from the early 1800s, European control of Africa gained momentum.The subsequent heightening  of tensions resulted in the near-complete reduction of Africa to European rule. African colonies were essentially artificial creations, lines drawn on maps to suit the colonizing powers. They took  no notice of local histories and cultures, and any local resistance to colonization was invariably crushed by military means. 
Belgian and German rule
In 1885, Leopold II, the King of  the Belgians, proclaimed the establishment of the Congo Free State, an area 76 times larger  than Belgium. Presented as  a model colony, dedicated to humanitarian ends and free trade,  
in reality it was anything but. 
Treated by Leopold II as his 
personal possession, the Congo witnessed brutalities on a near-genocidal scale. The exact numbers can never be known, but it is believed that between 2 million  and 10 million Congolese died. Conditions in German southwest Africa, suddenly taken over after 1884 and today part of Namibia, were equally brutal . The true price 
of the riches produced by Africa  for its European masters—ivory, rubber, gold, and diamonds—was extraordinary suffering.

vital extremities of Africa: Cape Town and Cairo. Having made  
his fortune mining and selling diamonds in South Africa, he dedicated the rest of his life to this audacious vision. He was able to carve out new British territories in Northern Rhodesia (now part of Zambia) and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), which were both named after him. As the prime minister of Britain’s Cape Colony from 1890, his relentless scheming to topple the Boer republics led to his eventual political demise in 1895. He remains perhaps the most striking example of the unashamed imperialist, not  
just permanently ready to extend British colonial control, but convinced that it was his duty to do so in the interests  
of what seemed to him a self-evident European fitness to rule.

 THE YOUNG TURK REVOLUTION (1908)
T  he Young Turk Revolution 
of July 1908 was instigated by nationalistic army 
officers dismayed by the territorial losses of the Ottoman Empire. It forced the sultan—the Ottoman ruler, the ineffective but repressive Abdul Hamid II—to reintroduce the constitutional monarchy that he had suspended in 1878 in favor  of personal rule after only two years. In 1909, he was forced to abdicate in favor of his brother, Mehmed V, who was merely  
a figurehead.

Territorial decline
In 1800, despite repeated defeats  at the hands of the Russians, Ottoman Turkey still ruled over  a vast multinational empire that stretched across the Balkans, the Middle East, and North Africa. From 1805, it lost control of  Egypt, which became effectively independent under one of the sultan’s generals, Muhammad Ali.
In 1830, the year that France 
began its conquest of Algeria (completed in 1857), Greece won  
its independence; and by 1878, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria,  
and Romania were similarly independent in all but name.  
In 1881, Tunisia, too, was taken over by France.
Following the Young Turk 
Revolution, the relentless decline  of Ottoman Turkey continued. In 1911, Libya was lost to Italy, while the Balkan Wars of 1912–13 saw the surrender of almost all of Turkey’s remaining European territories.
A fateful alliance
Following the Balkan crisis, the Ottomans’ military government launched a drive to modernize  
the country along Western lines.  In October 1914, Turkey entered World War I as an ally of the Central Powers—Germany and Austria-Hungary—convinced that German military aid would allow  
it to reassert its potency. This  
was a calamitous mistake, and defeat in 1918 saw Turkey reduced to its Anatolian heartlands, its remaining Middle East territories lost, largely carved up between Britain and France.
The traumas of Turkey’s defeat 
in World War I were underlined in 1920 by the Treaty of Sèvres, largely a Franco-British imposition. This confirmed the loss of Ottoman territory and also awarded much  of western Turkey to Greece, provoking an immediate nationalist backlash led by Mustafa Kemal,  as well as the overthrow of the  last sultan, Mehmed VI. 
The Turkey that emerged under 
Kemal, subsequently styled Atatürk (“Father of the Turks”), was exactly the centralized Western-style and, importantly, secular state that nationalist reformers such as the Young Turks had argued for.

as Atatürk (1881–1938), the name

by the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, the West effectively agreeing to the establishment of a new Turkish republic, Atatürk launched a radical program of social and political reforms intended to transform the nation into a modern, Westernized republic. However painful

 THE DEATH OF EMILY DAVISON (1913)
On June 4, 1913, Emily 
Davison stepped onto  the course at the Derby, 
England’s premier horse race, and was knocked to the ground by a horse owned by King George V. She died four days later. It is unclear if this was a protest that went wrong or an active attempt at martyrdom. However, the intended disruption was typical of the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU), which Davison had joined in 1906.

be regarded as second-class 
citizens. Extension of the right to vote to increasing numbers of men in countries such as Britain and  
the United States had left them asking why women should not be entitled to vote. In 1903, Emmeline Pankhurst founded the WSPU with the aim of using militant tactics  
to further this cause. Its slogan declared “Deeds not words,” and  
the tactics of the suffragettes,  as the vote-seeking women were  
by now mockingly known, became increasingly violent. Chaining themselves to public buildings and the disruption of meetings escalated into the smashing of shop windows, acts of arson, and bombings. 
The more active members of the 
WSPU were repeatedly arrested and imprisoned: Pankhurst received seven prison sentences; Davison, nine. In 1909, the WSPU began to stage hunger strikes in prison; in response they were force-fed—a painful and degrading process. 
The US: the suffragists
The experience of what in the US were known as the suffragists  had clear parallels. The Women’s Christian Temperance Union campaigned peacefully for women’s rights, arguing that women could not influence political decisions— in this case, Prohibition—without having the right to vote.
However, the National Women’s 
Party (NWP), established in 1916, imitated the militant tactics of Britain’s WSPU. This was no surprise, given that its founder, Alice Paul, had been a member of the WSPU from 1907 to 1910 and had been sent to prison three times. The NWP’s so-called Silent Sentinels, protesting outside the White House from January 1917, were also arrested and force-fed. 
Success at last
At the outbreak of World War I,  the WSPU stopped campaigning, mobilizing itself instead in support of the war effort. The contribution made by women during the war plainly demonstrated just how much wider their role could be than that traditionally expected of them as wives and mothers. In 1918, all British women aged 30 or over  were granted the right to vote.  In 1928, suffrage in Britain was extended to women aged 21 or over.
Meanwhile, in the United States, 
the NWP continued its protest into 1919, when Congress approved the Nineteenth Amendment, which was ratified the following year, granting women the same voting rights as men. 
■
Emmeline Pankhurst The best known of all the 
suffragettes, Emmeline Pankhurst (1858–1928) epitomized a new breed of politically active women in the early 20th century. She was born into—and later remained  
in by marriage—an eminently respectable, somewhat left-leaning middle-class world in  
the north of England, which only served to cement her desire to further the cause of women’s rights. This decision would prove explosive. She was single-minded, exceptionally active, and wholly unflinching in her refusal to compromise. Her leadership  of the WSPU exhibited a determination to take the fight for women’s suffrage into the heart of what she saw as the enemy camp. Her increasing readiness to use more violent methods to secure suffragette goals alienated many who may otherwise have been her natural supporters—women as much as men. Nonetheless, her absolute refusal to back down, coupled with the fervor she inspired  
in her followers, introduced a new mood of feminist militancy into a complacent masculine political world.

The experience of what in the US were known as the suffragists  had clear parallels. The Women’s Christian Temperance Union campaigned peacefully for women’s rights, arguing that women could not influence political decisions— in this case, Prohibition—without having the right to vote.
However, the National Women’s 
Party (NWP), established in 1916, imitated the militant tactics of Britain’s WSPU. This was no surprise, given that its founder, Alice Paul, had been a member of the WSPU from 1907 to 1910 and had been sent to prison three times. The NWP’s so-called Silent Sentinels, protesting outside the White House from January 1917, were also arrested and force-fed. 
Success at last
At the outbreak of World War I,  the WSPU stopped campaigning, mobilizing itself instead in support of the war effort. The contribution made by women during the war plainly demonstrated just how much wider their role could be than that traditionally expected of them as wives and mothers. In 1918, all British women aged 30 or over  were granted the right to vote.  In 1928, suffrage in Britain was extended to women aged 21 or over.
Meanwhile, in the United States, 
the NWP continued its protest into 1919, when Congress approved the Nineteenth Amendment, which was ratified the following year, granting women the same voting rights as men.

Emmeline Pankhurst The best known of all the 
suffragettes, Emmeline Pankhurst (1858–1928) epitomized a new breed of politically active women in the early 20th century. She was born into—and later remained  
in by marriage—an eminently respectable, somewhat left-leaning middle-class world in  
the north of England, which only served to cement her desire to further the cause of women’s rights. This decision would prove explosive. She was single-minded, exceptionally active, and wholly unflinching in her refusal to compromise. Her leadership  of the WSPU exhibited a determination to take the fight for women’s suffrage into the heart of what she saw as the enemy camp. Her increasing readiness to use more violent methods to secure suffragette goals alienated many who may otherwise have been her natural supporters—women as much as men. Nonetheless, her absolute refusal to back down, coupled with the fervor she inspired  
in her followers, introduced a new mood of feminist militancy into a complacent masculine political world.

THE PARTITIONS OF 
POLAND
(1772–95)
From 1569 to the 18th century, 
Poland and Lithuania were united in a large federated commonwealth that occupied an extensive area  of northern Europe. In 1772,  
the powerful neighbors of the commonwealth—Austria, Prussia,  and Russia—encroached on its territory in a series of annexations, diminishing it until they absorbed it fully in 1795. Russia took over the eastern half of the country; Prussia, the north; and Austria, the southern and central parts. The elimination of the Polish state bolstered these three great European powers, leaving Polish patriots to struggle for independence, which they achieved in 1918.
THE SIKH EMPIRE  
IS FOUNDED
(1799)
Maharaja Ranjit Singh brought together a group of Sikh states  in and surrounding the Punjab region of northern India to create  a powerful Sikh Empire in 1799.  For its creation and defense, it drew on the Khalsa, the powerful united army that had been created in the 1730s by Sikh leader Nawab Kapur Singh. The empire lasted for 50 years before falling to the British. Although not long-lasting, it helped to strengthen Sikh unity and confirmed the close identification of the Sikhs with the Punjab region.firepower. The British divided up their kingdom, eventually adding Zululand to their empire.
THE TRAIL OF TEARS 
(1830)
In 1830, the US Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which granted Native Americans lands west of the Mississippi in return for them surrendering their lands within existing state boundaries in the east. Although the removal was in theory voluntary, in fact it resulted in the eviction of tens of thousands of people from their homelands  on a forced westward march that became known as the Trail of Tears. The people forced to move were mainly Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole. Among the Cherokee alone, some 4,000 died during the march. 
THE IRISH FAMINE 
(1845–49)
In the 1840s, the rapidly growing rural population of Ireland suffered a series of disastrously poor crops of their staple food, the potato. These bad harvests, due to potato blight that spread rapidly in the damp weather, led to about  1 million people dying of starvation, while another million emigrated either to Britain or North America. After the famine ended, emigration, especially to the US, continued as landlords evicted tenants as part of estate “rationalization.” The famine was a terrible and pivotal event in FURTHER EVENTS
THE WAR OF 1812
(1812–15)
In 1812, the United States declared war on Britain over a number of issues, including trade restrictions, British commandeering of US merchant seamen, and the support lent by Britain to American Indian peoples who opposed US expansion into their lands to the west. The conflict took place on several  fronts across North America and involved a failed US invasion of Canada, the burning of the city  of Washington by the British in 1814, and a major US victory at  New Orleans in 1815. After more than two years of fighting, the status quo was largely restored. However, the war gave the US a stronger sense of nationhood and confirmed that Canada remained part of the British Empire. 
THE RISE AND FALL  
OF THE ZULU KINGDOM
(c.1816–87)
Shaka, ruler of a small Zulu chiefdom, was a dynamic leader who formed a Zulu state after  1816 by conquering and uniting  a large number of groups of the Nguni people of southeast Africa. The Zulu kingdom had to contend with two belligerent groups of incomers: the Boers (descendants of Dutch settlers at the Cape) and the British. The British invaded Zulu territory in 1879 and, after suffering an initial defeat at Isandiwana, overwhelmed them with their

THE TAIPING REBELLION
(1850–64)
By the mid-19th century, Qing  
rule in China had become corrupt, and there were many who wanted change. Among various anti-government groups was one led by a religious leader, Hong Xiuquan. Hong’s followers attacked Nanjing and took the city in 1853. The rebellion grew and spread across virtually all of China until it became a war with hundreds of thousands of fighters involved. With European military aid, the Qings eventually managed to crush the rebels, and millions of soldiers and civilians were killed. Despite its failure, the Taiping Rebellion fatally weakened the Qing regime, which only survived for another half century, increasingly prey to foreign powers.
THE CRIMEAN WAR
(1853–56)
When war broke out between Russia and Turkey in 1853, France and Britain intervened in support  of Turkey, sending a joint force to invade the Crimea and besiege the Russian port of Sebastapol. There were huge numbers of casualties, particularly on the Russian side, before Russia agreed to peace terms. Blunders such as the British cavalry’s infamous, suicidal Charge of the Light Brigade made the war notorious for the needless waste of human life. The Crimean War also came to be associated with the efforts of health reformers such as Florence Nightingale, who worked to improve the nursing service offered to the wounded and to improve training for nurses in both military and civilian hospitals.
FRANCE RETURNS TO A 
REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT
(1870)
In 1870, Emperor Napoleon III of 
France surrendered at the Battle  of Sedan, during the Franco-Prussian War, and he was taken prisoner. The French parliament declared a republic, expecting it  to form an interim government  until a new monarch was chosen. However, it proved impossible  to decide on a constitutional framework for a new monarchy,  or on who should take the throne. After elections in 1871, the Third Republic became permanent, with a president as head of state and a Chamber of Deputies, elected through universal male suffrage,  to make the laws. The Third Republic lasted until 1940 and  set the pattern for French government after World War II.
A MAHDIST ISLAMIC STATE 
IS CREATED IN SUDAN
(1885)
In 1881, the Sudanese leader 
Muhammad Ahmad declared himself the Mahdi (a messianic figure in some Muslim traditions) and launched a revolt against the government of Egypt, which ruled Sudan although Britain effectively controlled both countries. Ahmad laid siege to Khartoum, which fell in early 1885, in spite of a defense by Charles George Gordon, the British Governor-General. The Mahdists were finally defeated by Lord Kitchener in 1898, after which Sudan was ruled jointly by Britain and Egypt.
THE [SECOND] BOER WAR
(1899–1902)
The war of 1899–1902 was the second conflict between the Boers (South Africans of Dutch descent) and the British. After initial Boer victories, the British defeated their enemies by applying a “scorched earth” policy in the areas of the country in which the Boers had fought successfully as guerrillas, and capturing women and children. Some 20,000 died in concentration camps, and the Boers lost their independence. The war reduced many surviving Boers to poverty, but it also spurred on their nationalism and indirectly led  
to Afrikaaner dominance of  
South Africa’s government in  
the 20th century.
THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION
(1910)
Beginning in 1910 and initially led by Francisco Madero, the Mexican Revolution removed the dictator Porfirio Diaz, who had ruled for some 35 years. However, the  new republic could not prevent armed factional struggles and civil war, which continued until the drawing up of a new constitution  in 1917 and the election of a new government in 1920. The following two decades saw key reforms such as the redistribution of lands among peasants and Indian communities and, in 1938,  the nationalization of oil.

Historical perspectives on 
events close to the present day are inevitably shifting 
and uncertain. A historian writing in the mid-20th century might have characterized the modern era as a period of catastrophe, in which all the economic and political gains  of liberal civilization had been squandered. However, by the early 21st century it was tempting to see continuity with the pre-1914 world, as a globalized capitalist economy and great technological innovation were combined with rapidly rising population and productivity. 
The two world wars 
The convulsions of the period from 1914 to 1950 were on an epic scale. Two world wars between them caused the deaths of between  70 and 100 million people, making them by far the most destructive conflicts in history. Both European civilization and science—the twin pillars of the traditional 19th-century idea of “progress”—were tarnished by association with this slaughter. Germany, often considered one of Europe’s most “civilized” countries, descended into dictatorship and genocidal massacre. Science was used to create weapons of mass destruction, from poison gas to the atom bomb. Even in the interlude  of relative peace between the world wars, global capitalism failed to function effectively, the economic misery of the Great Depression driving a retreat from democratic government and free markets. 
To revolutionaries inspired by  
a Marxist vision, these upheavals seemed the death throes of the capitalist order. But the building of alternative “communist” societies, based on the model of a single-party state and a state-controlled economy, proved to be a costly experiment. In Russia, followed by China, communism succeeded in transforming relatively undeveloped countries into major industrial and military powers, but millions died as victims of the state, and citizens were denied fundamental freedoms. 
A battle of ideology 
World War II was followed by the Cold War confrontation between the “free world,” led by the United States, and the communist bloc. Instead of disarmament, there was a potentially disastrous nuclear arms race. Meanwhile, the main European powers, economically weakened and demoralized, found themselves in no position to sustain INTRODUCTION

In the end, the issue was settled

Progress and pessimism
From the 1960s, hotly contested campaigns for civil rights had progressed liberal ideals in areas such as racial equality and gender politics. Growing prosperity was also impressive. In Latin America and much of Asia, living standards had risen dramatically by the early 21st century. Despite the world’s population increasing on a huge scale—from under 2 billion in 1914 to over 7 billion one century later— food supplies had not run out, as had once been predicted by many.

History offered no solid ground for predictions, suggesting only that the unexpected was to  be expected.

 THE BATTLE OF PASSCHENDAELE (1914)
US_270-275_Passchendale.indd   271 15/02/2016   16:44272
Passchendaele, officially 
known as the Third Battle of Ypres, was a large- 
scale attack against the German front line around Ypres, Belgium, during World War I. The Allies’  aim was to advance into Belgium and free the German-held ports  on the Belgian coast, which  
the Germans had been using to attack British shipping. The  
biggest challenge was to break through the defensive positions taken by the Germans on the  
West Flanders Ridge. Key to the breakthrough was seizing the village of Passchendaele.
Preparations for the battle 
began on June 7, 1917 with a heavy two-week bombardment of German positions. The infantry offensive began on July 31, 1917. Within days, the Allied forces were stuck in mud as torrential rain turned the area into a quagmire. By the time the Allies—made up of British, French, Canadian, and Australian troops—captured Passchendaele on November 6, the village was in ruins. The conflict cost 300,000 Allied lives, with a gain of 5 miles (8km), while the Germans lost 260,000 of their troops. It was hailed as a victory by the British government but became a byword for the utter futility of war. 
Secret diplomacy
Two main disputes led to World War I: one between Germany and France, and the other between Russia and Austria-Hungary. The long history of mutual antipathy between Germany and France came to a head in 1870 with France’s humiliating defeat by Germany in the Franco-Prussian 
Life in the trenches At the outbreak of World War I, 
both sides anticipated fast-moving battles that would cover hundreds of miles. None expected a static fight with their forces deep in defensive trenches. 
Early trenches were small 
furrows, but they grew more elaborate, fortified with wooden frames and sandbags. German trenches were more sophisticated and had electricity and toilets. Soldiers spent daylight hours avoiding enemy fire and endured periods of boredom and daily chores, broken up with spells in reserve and short rest periods. The trenches sometimes filled up with rats and lice, as well  
as water, which turned to ice. Life in such conditions was exhausting, and soldiers had  
a repetitive diet of canned food  
and few comforts. 
Snipers shot at any heads 
that appeared over the parapet, and raiding parties throwing grenades were a constant danger. The trenches were bombarded with shells, bullets, and poisonous gas. It was a relentless war of attrition—smelly, dirty, and riddled  with disease.THE BATTLE OF PASSCHENDAELE

war, which led to the annexation  
of most of the French provinces of Alsace and Lorraine.
In Eastern Europe, the Austro-
Hungarian and Russian empires had a long-standing dispute over which of them had the strongest claim to power in the Balkans. Both depended on the area for access to the Mediterranean, and each eyed the movements of the other with intense suspicion. 
Each state needed allies, and  
in 1882 Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Italy signed a Triple Alliance promising to give each other military support in case of war. Then, in the 1890s, Russia and France signed an agreement to protect one another in the event of  
a war against Germany. By the turn of the century, Kaiser Wilhelm II’s provocative nationalistic speeches and naval expansion pushed Britain into closer ties with France. In 1904, Britain and France agreed  an 
entente cordiale , or friendly 
alliance, which was broadened into a triple entente, embracing Russia, in 1907. The triple entente would become known as the Allied Powers. The atmosphere generated by this international jostling led to an increase in military spending  by European governments and the expansion of armies and navies. 
War erupts

war, which led to the annexation  
of most of the French provinces of Alsace and Lorraine.
In Eastern Europe, the Austro-
Hungarian and Russian empires had a long-standing dispute over which of them had the strongest claim to power in the Balkans. Both depended on the area for access to the Mediterranean, and each eyed the movements of the other with intense suspicion. 
Each state needed allies, and  
in 1882 Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Italy signed a Triple Alliance promising to give each other military support in case of war. Then, in the 1890s, Russia and France signed an agreement to protect one another in the event of  
a war against Germany. By the turn of the century, Kaiser Wilhelm II’s provocative nationalistic speeches and naval expansion pushed Britain into closer ties with France. In 1904, Britain and France agreed  an 
entente cordiale , or friendly 
alliance, which was broadened into a triple entente, embracing Russia, in 1907. The triple entente would become known as the Allied Powers. The atmosphere generated by this international jostling led to an increase in military spending  by European governments and the expansion of armies and navies.

a small professional troop led by Sir 
Douglas Haig, had arrived in France by August 22. It was deployed near the Franco-Belgian border, in line with pre-war military plans agreed with the French government. 
Germany had to fight a war on 
two fronts. On the Western Front,  in the first weeks of the conflict,  the Germans invaded Belgium  and France, but their advance  was halted by the French and British at the Battle of the Marne.  By the end of autumn, the two  sides had reached a stalemate. Meanwhile, on the Eastern Front, the fighting remained fluid. Germany dominated, scoring a great victory against the Russians at Tannenberg, but its Austrian allies suffered several defeats.  
On the Western Front, however,  
a 400-mile (645km) trench line stretched from the Belgian coast  
in the north, down through eastern France to the Swiss border. The two sides faced each other across the open space between their front lines. This area—no-man’s-land—had barbed wire fronting the trenches to slow the opposition. Continuous fighting from the trenches, punctuated by appallingly bloody battles, failed to break the deadlock. More than 600,000 Allied troops were killed or wounded in the Battle of the Somme alone.
Total war
At the start of the conflict, both sides had been convinced it would be a short, decisive battle. No one THE BATTLE OF PASSCHENDAELE

New mechanized weapons added to the high casualty rates. Tanks were used for the first time, and machine guns such as the German MG 08 Maxim could fire up to 600 bullets  
a minute. Aircrafts, first employed for reconnaissance, were later used for bombing. Both sides used poison gas. Horses were the backbone  
of logistical operations, but as  
the war progressed, railways and motor trucks were used to transport goods to the front. 
Civilians were brought into  
the front line by the bombing of London and Paris by airships and bomber aircraft. By 1917, German submarines were sinking one in four merchant ships headed for Britain to try to starve the British into submission. Britain’s naval blockade of Germany also led to 
World War I is also known as the Great War, due  
to the unprecedented number of participants. An enormous 65 million soldiers saw combat, almost a third of whom were wounded and half as many again were killed. In addition, 8 million civilians lost their lives. These high figures are a direct consequence of  the array of devastating new weapons that were in  use by all of the armies involved.6

 THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION (1917)
In October 1917, Russia was  
in turmoil after suffering  huge losses in World War I. 
There were food shortages, and workers in the cities faced low wages and appalling conditions. The February Revolution had ousted the Tsar, but the Provisional Government that replaced him faced imminent collapse. 
Vladimir Lenin, a member of the 
revolutionary Bolshevik Party, took full advantage. He was committed to a workers’ (proletarian) revolution and set out a series of proposals to overthrow the government in what became known as his April Theses. His simple slogan “Peace, land, and bread!” became a revolutionary IN CONTEXT

Soldiers refused to obey orders to fire on the crowd, but police shot and killed 50 people. 
Rise of revolutionary parties
With violence erupting on city streets, the Tsar abdicated in March, having relinquished power to the Provisional Government in February, with Prince Georgi Y. Lvov as its head. The government still represented only the middle classes and continued to back Russia’s involvement in World War I. Groups such as the Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers, a council made up of workers and peasants agitating for change, grew stronger and gained power within the Provisional Government. Lenin, in exile for revolutionary activities, was anxious to return to Petrograd, convinced that the collapse of  
world capitalism was imminent.  
He received the help of the German government, which hoped that  
he could further destabilize the political situation in Russia for their war effort, and arrived secretly in a sealed train. Full of revolutionary zeal, he was determined to shape a new Russian government according to his ideas, and he accused his associates of not doing enough to overthrow the current regime. 
Prime Minister Lvov resigned 
after the disastrous July Offensive on the Western Front. His successor, Alexander Kerensky, formed a  
new socialist government with  the Petrograd Soviet, but he, too, insisted on keeping Russia in the war. After mass demonstrations  in Petrograd encouraged by the Bolsheviks, Kerensky banned them and arrested many of their leaders. Lenin fled to Finland. 
Revolution is nigh 
In August, Kerensky faced a new threat. General Lavr Kornilov, Russia’s army commander-in-chief, ordered troops into Petrograd. Kerensky believed that Kornilov was plotting to seize power. In desperation, he released the Bolsheviks, who armed those  who wanted to prevent a counter-revolution. This was a massive boost for their cause. They were able to represent themselves to the people as defenders of Petrograd. By September the Bolsheviks had taken control of the Petrograd Soviet. Lenin seized the moment, THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION

calls for revolution. He handed responsibility for military tactics  to Leon Trotsky, a fellow Marxist. Peasants and farmers were revolting in rural areas, workers in the cities. Lenin decided the time was ripe for a Bolshevik seizure of power. The Bolsheviks took government buildings and the Winter Palace, where Kerensky’s cabinet had sought refuge. 
On the night of October 25 
(November 7, GC), Lenin issued a brief address to the Russian people: “The Provisional Government has been overthrown. Long live the workers, soldiers, and peasant revolution!” After this initial triumph, Lenin was compelled to hold democratic elections, but the Bolsheviks received only a quarter of the vote. Lenin dissolved the elected government and sent armed guards to prevent it meeting again. In February 1918, he signed a peace treaty with Germany, but the terms were extremely harsh.  Russia ceded the Baltic States to Germany, while Ukraine, Finland, and Estonia were transformed  into independent states. Russia was also forced to pay six billion German marks in reparations.  This move freed the Bolsheviks from the German threat, but the terms of the treaty were deeply unpopular. Many regarded it as  a betrayal of their country. 
Civil war 
The Bolsheviks had gained power, but now they had to keep it. Lenin established a highly centralized government system, banned all

opposition, and started the Red 
Terror, a campaign of intimidation, executions, and arrests against anybody perceived to be a threat  to the Bolsheviks. 
The Bolsheviks were a minority 
in Russia, and their opponents marshalled their forces against them, primarily the Whites, made up of former tsarists, army officers, and democrats. The Bolsheviks were known as the Reds. 
As various factions fought over 
the future of the country, a civil war characterized by extreme violence erupted in Russia and ran from 1918 to 1921. The Whites received help from Russia’s former allies—Britain, France, the US, and Japan—which feared the spread of communism. At first, they made significant gains. However, they were badly coordinated, and Trotsky proved to be a brilliant military tactician. 
In 1920, Lenin ordered a war 
against Poland to liberate the workers of eastern and central Europe, but at the Battle of Warsaw, after a magnificent counterattack, the Red Army was driven back. A country in ruins 
By 1921, the Whites had been defeated, and Lenin could finally turn his attention to rebuilding  the Russian economy. 
He faced a country on the verge 
of collapse. In the countryside, around 6 million peasants had died of starvation, and there was rioting in the cities. The Kronstadt naval rebellion in March 1921 further undermined the regime. Kronstadt was a naval town on an island off the coast of Petrograd. In 1921, 16,000 soldiers and workers signed a petition calling for “Soviets without Bolsheviks”: freely elected Soviets and freedoms of speech and press. The Reds reacted ruthlessly, executing several hundred ringleaders and expelling over 15,000 sailors from the fleet.
In May 1922, Lenin suffered  
a stroke. In December, the  Soviet government declared the establishment of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR),  a federal union consisting of  Soviet Russia and neighboring areas that were ruled by branches THE MODERN WORLD
of the communist movement.  From its inception, the USSR  was based on a premise of one-party rule, prohibiting all other political organizations.
Lenin was disheartened by 
political infighting and worried about how the USSR would be run after his death. In late 1922 and early 1923, he dictated what became known as his “testament,” in which he expressed regret at the direction the Soviet government had taken. He was especially critical of Joseph Stalin, then general secretary  of the Communist Party. Stalin’s aggressive behavior had brought him into conflict with Lenin.
Lenin died in 1924, but his 
legacy lives on. The Bolshevik Party’s establishment of the world’s first socialist state in the largest nation affected every country in  the world. The victorious socialist revolution inspired workers  with an alternative to capitalism and old imperialist regimes.

In late 1922 and early 1923, he dictated what became known as his “testament,” in which he expressed regret at the direction the Soviet government had taken. He was especially critical of Joseph Stalin, then general secretary  of the Communist Party. Stalin’s aggressive behavior had brought him into conflict with Lenin.
Lenin died in 1924, but his 
legacy lives on. The Bolshevik Party’s establishment of the world’s first socialist state in the largest nation affected every country in  the world. The victorious socialist revolution inspired workers  with an alternative to capitalism and old imperialist regimes.

The founding of the United Nations 340After four years of global 
conflict, 16 million people had died and centuries- 
old empires and dynasties had collapsed. In January 1919, the victors of World War I met to discuss the terms of peace. US Presiden t Woodrow Wilson had 
devised a plan that he believed would bring a new order to Europe based on democracy. Wilson pushed for a League of Nations  to act as arbiter and peacemaker  in national disputes. 
Britain and France wanted  
to ensure that Germany would never again be able to threaten European peace. The German Army was to be reduced and the Rhineland demilitarized. Germany was also asked to give up lands to France on its west and to Poland  on its east and north. In addition, the Austro-Hungarian empires were to be split into new nations such as Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia; and the Ottoman Empire was also to be carved up,  to the advantage of the British  and French. 
War-guilt clause
Crucially, in a “war-guilt clause,” the Germans had to admit to starting the war and also pay £6.6 billion in reparations. They signed the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, 1919 but stalled in paying compensation, so in 1923 France occupied Germany’s industrial Ruhr Valley. However, in the interwar years, neither of those nations did anything to deter aggression by Nazi Germany. When Adolf Hitler took France in 1940, he ordered the master copy of the treaty to be burned.

FUTURE OF THE UNITED

 THE WALL STREET CRASH (1929)
Over six desperate days  
in October 1929, shares  on the New York Stock 
Exchange crashed. The downturn began on October 23rd, when stocks from car manufacturer General Motors were sold at a loss and the market started to collapse. Panic set in, and the next day the market nose-dived. 
On Tuesday October 29, which 
became known as Black Tuesday, stock prices plunged even lower.  In total, $25 billion, approximately $319 billion in today’s market, was lost. It was the biggest financial catastrophe ever, and it plunged the world into the Great Depression. 
Roaring Twenties
The US had recovered quickly after World War I, and factories that had made supplies for the war effort switched to producing consumer goods such as cars and radios. The growth of new technologies and mass production saw economic output increase by 50 percent; the age of prosperity and consumerism that resulted became known as  the Roaring Twenties. 
Newspapers and magazines 
were filled with stories of people becoming rich overnight by dabbling in the stock market, and thousands of ordinary Americans bought shares, increasing the demand for them and inflating their value. Between 1920 and 1929, the number of shareowners rose from 4 million to 20 million. 
By late 1929, there were signs  
of trouble within the American economy: unemployment was  on the rise, steel production  was declining, construction was slowing, and car sales had dipped. Still confident they could make  a fortune, some people continued  to invest on the stock market.

However, when the stock prices 
began to drop in October 1929, panic set in. The ensuing crash triggered a worldwide recession known as the Great Depression. 
The Great Depression 
In the US, factories were  closed and workers sacked. In  the spring of 1933, the agricultural sector was on the verge of disaster: 25 percent of farmers were without work, and many even lost their farms. Unemployment went from 1.5 million in 1929 to 12.8 million,  or 24.75 percent of the workforce,  by 1933, a pattern seen around  the world. 
Unemployment in Britain rose  
to 2.5 million, 25 percent of the workforce, with heavy industry, such as shipbuilding, particularly badly hit. Germany suffered greatly, since its post-war economy was supported by huge American loans which it was unable to pay back. 
A New Deal
The crash helped bring Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt into the  White House in 1932. His policy,  the New Deal, introduced a program of social welfare  for the poor and government expenditure on huge public  projects that created new jobs. 
The Great Depression marked 
the end of the United States’ post-war boom. In Europe many turned to right-wing parties, such as Adolf Hitler’s National Socialist Party  in Germany, with its promise to restore the economy. In many countries, recovery came only  with the increase in employment brought about by World War II.

 THE REICHSTAG FIRE (1933)
When fire broke out at the 
Reichstag, the German parliament building,  
just after 9pm on February 27, 1933, Chancellor Adolf Hitler claimed it was a communist plot to bring down the government—a cynical ploy that gave Hitler an excuse to decimate his communist rivals. The timing was perfect: elections were due to take place in March 1933. While Hitler’s National Socialist, or “Nazi,” Party was  
the largest party in parliament, he lacked a working majority because the two next-largest parties (the Social Democrats and Communists) were both on the left, and he feared IN CONTEXT

his party would not fare well in the 
elections. Hitler rushed to blame  
the fire on a lone Dutch communist, which prompted suspicions that  
the Nazis were behind the arson,  
given that they had so much to gain from discrediting the communists. 
The next day, the Reichstag Fire 
Decree banned the Communist Party. Hitler’s response fed on fears of a communist takeover, and many Germans believed that Hitler’s decisive action had saved the nation. By April, under pressure from the Nazis, the Enabling Act was passed by the Reichstag. This granted Hitler the right to make his own laws without involving the Reichstag, and it solidified his place as a fascist dictator with complete control over Germany. 
Dictators seize power 
Fascism emerged across Europe in the 1920s and 30s. As governments struggled with post-war economic hardship and the fear of communist revolutions, extreme right-wing movements—fascism in Italy and Nazism in Germany—were set up as defenders against communism. They used paramilitary groups to intimidate opponents, and spread propaganda to gain popularity. In Italy, Benito Mussolini was seen as the only man able to restore order. Once appointed prime minister in 1922, Mussolini gradually assumed dictatorial powers, becoming Il Duce , the leader. By 1928, Italy was 
a totalitarian state. 
In Germany, Hitler worked 
ceaselessly to transform the Nazis into a major political force. Relying on a mix of nationalist rhetoric, anti-communism, vicious anti-Semitism, and an unceasing call to reverse the peace terms made at Versailles in 1919, Hitler rode a wave of popularity. In 1933 he became Chancellor, then, shortly after, dictator, calling himself Führer . 
Fascists united 
In 1936 Hitler and Mussolini began to send military support to aid General Franco in the Spanish  Civil War, which pitted right-wing nationalists against left-wing republicans. Franco’s victory against the left-wing Popular  Front government emboldened  the dictators and emphasized the weakness of Western democracies. 
The Reichstag Fire was a key 
moment in Nazi history. It led to the absolute dictatorship of Adolf Hitler and the growth of fascism, setting Europe on the path to world war.

Fascism across Europe 
European fascism blossomed in 
a climate of economic disarray in the 1920s and 30s. Democracies lost legitimacy with their people, and fascist parties, offering a form of extreme right-wing nationalism, boasted that they would provide strength where weakness had prevailed. 
In the 1930s, no European 
country, with the exception of the Soviet Union, was without  
a form of fascist party. Britain had Sir Oswald Mosley’s British Union of Fascists (BUF). Ireland had the Blueshirts; France, Le Faisceau; and Denmark and Norway had many far-right parties. Engelbert Dollfuss’s Fatherland Front was installed in Austria in 1934, while Greece was under the rule of General Ioannis Metaxas between 1936 and 1941. Portugal and Bulgaria also came under right-wing dictatorships, as did Romania.
By the end of the 1930s, 
authoritarian governments had assumed power in virtually every corner of central and Eastern Europe, and democracy was in decline. Ours is a fight to the  
finish until communism  
has been absolutely

In August 1939, Nazi Germany 
and the Soviet Union signed  a non-aggression pact, also  
secretly agreeing to invade and then divide Poland between them. Russian leader Joseph Stalin had decided that in the event of war, Germany offered the best hope of Soviet security. One week later,  on September 1, 1939, more than  a million German troops invaded Poland from the west. Soon after, on September 17, Russian troops attacked Poland from the east. The context for this unprovoked assault, as declared by the German Führer , 
Adolf Hitler, was the pursuit of Lebensraum , “living space” deemed 
necessary for the expansion of the German people, whom Hitler saw as a superior “Aryan master race,” with the right to displace inferior races.
The invasion lasted just over  
a month. Trapped between two huge, well-armed powers, the Polish air force and army fought valiantly, but they lacked modern aircrafts and tanks. The German Luftwaffe was quickly able to  gain command of the skies. In  the end, Poland’s aviators and soldiers, fighting on two fronts, were overwhelmed. The invasion ended in a resounding victory, and it added to Hitler’s increasing belief that he was a military genius. Some areas in western Poland were absorbed  into Germany, while territory east  
of the River Bug was annexed by  
the Soviet Union. 
The Nazi regime in Poland 
The Nazis imposed a brutal regime on the German part of Poland.  Hitler was bent on the elimination of anyone who stood in the way of German domination. 
As part of Hitler’s plan for  
ethnic cleansing, around 5 million Polish Jews were rounded up  and herded into ghettos. The invasion of Poland gave some forewarning of the violence that would soon be visited upon  scores of countries and countless people around the globe.

The West intervenes
Hitler’s invasion of Poland, which 
began on September 1, 1939, finally forced Britain and France into  
a war they had been trying desperately to avoid. Deciding  
that they needed to take a tougher stance against Hitler after his takeover of Czechoslovakia, the  two nations had guaranteed Poland support in the event of German aggression. Honoring this promise, they declared war on Germany on September 3, which meant British and French colonies were also drawn into conflict: Britain’s dominions Australia and New Zealand declared war immediately, the Union of South Africa followed on September 6, and Canada on September 10. 
Germany quickly overran 
Poland with its tactic of blitzkrieg  
(“lightning war”), which utilized tank divisions supported by the Luftwaffe, the German air force. The British sent an Expeditionary Force (BEF) to France, but neither Britain nor France attempted  
an offensive against Germany. They were not ready for a large-scale attack, and some politicians still believed that peace terms could be negotiated.
This period became known as 
the “Phoney War.” Expecting to be bombed, Britain began to evacuate its children from major cities. Air-raid shelters were built, and gas masks handed out. The Phoney War ended in April 1940, when Germany attacked and conquered Denmark and Norway. A month later, they turned on France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The French army was poorly led and badly equipped. France had relied on the Maginot Line, a chain of fortresses along the frontier with Germany, to halt any attack. But the fortification did not extend along the Franco-Belgian border, and the Germans simply bypassed it at the north end. Within the space of six weeks, France had fallen to the German onslaught.
The Battle of Britain
Only a hesitation by Hitler, who may have wanted to rest his troops and spare them from a possible counterattack, prevented the destruction of British forces before NAZI INVASION OF POLAND
Operation Dynamo , in June 1940, 
focused on the evacuation of Allied 
soldiers from the port of Dunkirk,  in France, after they had become surrounded by German troops.they could be evacuated by sea 
from Dunkirk. Thousands of Allied soldiers were transferred across  the Channel in all kinds of vessels in Operation Dynamo. Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty and later Britain’s wartime prime minister, told the British parliament, “The Battle of France is over. I expect the Battle  of Britain is about to begin.” 
However, Hitler’s attempts  
to invade Britain in Operation Sea Lion had to be abandoned  after the Luftwaffe failed to win  the battle of the skies. With the Luftwaffe triumphant in both Poland and France, the Germans had hoped that Britain could  be beaten by air power alone. However, German crews were exhausted, intelligence was poor, and Britain’s use of radar enabled the Royal Air Force (RAF) to track incoming planes and take off in time to meet an attack. The Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940 We shall defend our island 
whatever the cost may be.  
We shall fight on beaches, 
landing grounds, in fields,  
in streets, and on the hills.  
We shall never surrender.

was the first real check on Hitler’s progress, but Britain alone could not fight a power that now had control of almost the entire continent.
The world at war
What started as a European war gradually became a world war. In June 1940, Italy, emboldened by German successes, declared war on Britain and France, fulfilling  the terms of the Axis agreement made between Hitler and Mussolini on May 22, 1939. But Italy’s failures in Greece and North Africa  forced Hitler to send German armies into these areas, as well  as Yugoslavia.
On September 7, 1940 Germany 
began its first major air raid on London. The Blitz, as the bombing of the English capital became known, thrust civilians into the war and put relentless pressure on industry, ports, and British morale. With men joining the army, women were required to work in factories and on farms. Food rationing was introduced in Britain in January 1940, and  people were urged to grow their own food. Nazi-occupied Europe also experienced food shortages, which weighed most heavily on  the conquered populations. 
Collaboration or exile
In some locations, the Germans worked with existing governments and fully supported puppet administrations, such as the pro-Nazi Vidkun Quisling in Norway and the Vichy regime in southern France. Led by Marshal Philippe Pétain, Vichy was officially neutral, but it collaborated closely with Germany, fighting the French resistance, and implementing  anti-Semitic legislation. 
Germany had total control in 
Poland and eventual control of the Baltic states. Monarchs and politicians of more than a dozen occupied countries escaped to Britain. Polish ministers set up headquarters in London, and Belgium’s government operations were transferred there. The  Dutch royal family, under Queen THE MODERN WORLD
Wilhelmina, also sought refuge  
in London. When France fell to Germany, Charles de Gaulle,  who opposed the newly installed Vichy government, became the voice of French opposition to the  
Nazi occupation. 
In 1940 the biggest threat  
facing Britain was from German U-boats. As an island, Britain was dependent on its merchant ships to bring in vital supplies but also to export equipment to its fighting forces abroad, and German U-boats were sinking dozens of Allied  ships each month. Merchant ships traveled in convoy to increase  the chances of supplies getting through on each journey, but casualties were high.
Fighting the USSR
In June 1941, Britain gained a  new ally when Germany invaded the USSR in Operation Barbarossa. Hitler had looked to the Soviet Union for new territory for the German people. It would also remove any future threat from the east but

hardships. German tanks plowed 
through the Red Army defenses. Prisoners of war were shot or left  to starve. Fleeing civilians were butchered without a moment’s hesitation. The harshness of the Russian winter slowed the Germans, and Russian counterattacks drove back their front line by several hundred miles. In the Battle  of Moscow, from early October  1941 to January 1942, an estimated 650,000 soldiers from the Soviet Army lost their lives. In the spring of 1942, the Germans resumed their offensive in the USSR, driving the Red Army back and coming close to taking the Russian oilfields.
The Pacific and Africa
In December 1941, Japan entered the war by attacking the US fleet  
at Pearl Harbor, in the Hawaiian Islands, as part of its plan to drive American forces out of the Pacific. Germany—which had a tripartite agreement with Japan and Italy to provide mutual military assistance in the event any one of them was attacked by a nation not already involved in the war—immediately declared war on the United States. Britain now had two strong allies, the USSR under Joseph Stalin, and the US, led by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Both were decisive in bringing about the defeat of the Axis powers. American industry became a triumph of wartime production, giving Americans in combat in Europe and Asia the tools they needed to fight the Axis.
Japan won quick victories in  
the Pacific. It successfully captured  the Philippines, Malaya, Burma, Indonesia, and Singapore, Britain’s main naval base in East Asia. 
In North Africa, meanwhile,  
a renewed Axis offensive led by General Erwin Rommel brought  the German and Italian armies within striking distance of Cairo and the Suez Canal. The first major Allied victory came in Egypt. In July 1942, Rommel was halted at El Alamein; in October, he was forced into retreat by the British 8th Army,  led by Field Marshal Montgomery. 
That same winter, the Red Army 
defeated the Nazis at Stalingrad. The Soviets encircled the Germans, forcing a surrender in February 1943. 
History knows no greater 
display of courage than  
that shown by the people  
of the Soviet Union.
Henry L. Stimson
US Secretary of Warfundamentally followed through on Hitler’s plan to destroy communism. At first it looked as if Germany and its allies would be as successful against the Russians as it had  been against the French. By winter, Germany had advanced to within  1 mile (1.5km) of Moscow, and Leningrad, the USSR’s second city, was under siege. 
Another powerful rationale for 
war in the east was one based on racist ideology and Hitler’s hatred of Slavs and Jews. As German troops swept into Russia, they inflicted  a terrible campaign of genocide against communists and Jews. Russian troops endured extreme Operation Barbarossa , launched  
in June 1941, saw the invasion of the 
Soviet Union by Germany, in breach  of the non-aggression pact the two countries had signed two years earlier.
General Dwight D. Eisenhower led the Allied forces during the Normandy landings of June 1944. The invasion was a decisive step toward taking Europe back from the Nazis.

Hiroshima and

American planes dropped 
atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to force Japan to surrender and end World War II. On August 6, 1945, “Little Boy” was dropped on Hiroshima. The inhabitants below had no idea what was about to happen. People, animals, and buildings were incinerated in the searing heat. Some 70,000 died immediately. Despite this terrible event, Japan did not surrender. 
Japan had cause to 
reconsider its position when the Soviets entered the war against them by crossing  
into Manchuria on August 9. When, that same afternoon, the US dropped “Fat Man”  
on Nagasaki, instantly killing 50,000, Japan was brought to its knees and agreed to the Allies’ terms of surrender. These unprecedented attacks avoided a bloody ground assault by the Allies on the Japanese mainland, but many thousands lost their lives as a result of the long-term effects of radiation sickness.THE MODERN WORLD
The turn of the tide
In a conference at Tehran in 
November 1943, the Allied leaders agreed on a strategy to liberate Europe. While the Russians drove the Germans back in the east, and the British and Americans advanced slowly through Italy, a huge Allied invasion force arrived in Normandy in June 1944. Eleven months later, it had reached the river Elbe in northern Germany, while Russian troops were advancing block by block through Berlin. Germany  was being hit repeatedly by British Lancaster bomber aircraft from Bomber Command and the US Eighth Air Force. Staring at defeat, Hitler committed suicide on April 30, and Germany surrendered unconditionally a week later.
The last act of the war came  
in August 1945, when the US,  after fighting island by island through the Pacific, put an end to Japanese resistance by dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima  and Nagasaki. The effects of the bombs were cataclysmic, inflicting unprecedented horror on the two Japanese cities. 
Nations united
Hitler’s invasion of Poland marked the start of World War II, the largest and most destructive war in history, by the end of which an estimated 60 million people had been killed. Like their predecessors in 1918, the Allies were determined that this should be the last war of its kind. 
Representatives of 50 nations 
met in 1945 to set up the United Nations. There was hope that this would mark the start of a new era  of international understanding.

QUESTION
 THE WANNSEE CONFERENCE ( 1942)
On January 20, 1942, 15 
members of the Nazi Party and German officials met 
in the Berlin suburb of Wannsee  to discuss the implementation  of the “Final Solution of the Jewish Quest ion”—the code name for the 
systematic annihilation of European Jews. During the conference, a tabulation of all the Jews in Europe was presented, country by country, as well as a target number for extermination: 11 million. The meeting lasted two hours and was matter-of-fact and dispassionate. After approving the “Final Solution” and the slaughter of the Jews, the men called for brandy and cigars. IN CONTEXT

The Wannsee Conference was far 
from the start of Nazi brutality against Jews. Adolf Hitler had come to power in 1933, spreading his belief that Germans were the Aryan master race, superior to all others, and that their blood should not be contaminated. He identified Jews as a race of people, not just  a religious group. German Jews were banned from marrying non-Jewish Germans and subjected  to increasing discrimination and segregation. From the time of the German takeover of Austria in 1938, Nazi brutality against Jews worsened. Jews wanting to flee German rule found other countries unwilling to accept them. 
Gathering momentum
After Germany’s invasion of Poland in 1939, the Nazi campaign against the Jews reached a terrifying new level. Herded into ghettoes, Polish Jews began to die in large numbers of starvation and ill-treatment. When Germany invaded Russia in 1941, paramilitary death squads carried out mass killings of Jews in the conquered areas. To start with, victims were shot, up to 30,000 at a time, but the SS then began gassing Jews in the backs of vans. Poison gas was found to be a more efficient way to commit mass murder. 
Until 1941, the Nazi leadership 
had envisaged solving the “Jewish problem” by deporting Jews to a distant location. By the time of the Wannsee Conference, however, they were committed to systematically killing Europe’s Jewish population. Six dedicated death camps were built in Poland. Adolf Eichmann of the Nazi paramilitary corps, the SS, arranged the transport of Jews to the camps from right across Europe, including France, Greece, Hungary, and Italy. The Jews from the Polish ghettos were also taken there to be exterminated. Prisoners arrived at these huge killing factories by train and were gassed in shower rooms, their corpses burned in large crematoria. At the Belzec camp, about half a million Jews were killed, and only seven prisoners are known to have survived. The death camp at Auschwitz, however, also had a labor camp attached, where those who were not killed on arrival were made to work. The Germans needed slave labor to support their war effort, and this offered Jews their best chance of survival. Along with other prisoners—including socialists, homosexuals, Roma, and prisoners of war—many Jews were sent to concentration camps. Their heads were shaved, and they were given a uniform to strip them of their identity. When the Allies liberated the camps in 1945, they found a vision of hell. The survivors were skeletal and traumatized.
State-sanctioned genocide
The Wannsee Protocol, the minutes of the conference, represents the unimaginable. For the first time, a modern state had committed itself to the murder of an entire people. As many as 6 million Jews lost their lives, and an estimated 5.5 million others—Slavs, homosexuals, communists—were also killed.

The Nuremberg Trials 
After the end of World War II, 
the Allies sought to bring the Nazis to justice. An international tribunal was held at Nuremberg, Germany, beginning in 1945. Newsreels captured from  
the Nazis revealed the gas chambers, the massacre of civilians, and the ill-treatment  
of prisoners. The trials were televised, showing to the  
world—and, in particular the German people—evidence of  
the horrors that had taken place in the concentration camps.Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, and Joseph Goebbels, head of propaganda, had committed suicide, leaving 24 defendants facing four counts: crimes against peace, planning and waging wars of aggression, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Most said they were “only obeying orders.” Albert Speer, head of war production, was jailed for 20 years, while  
12 of the other defendants were sentenced to death; the trials led to the setting up of a permanent international criminal court in The Hague, in the Netherlands.

The Wannsee Conference was far 
from the start of Nazi brutality against Jews. Adolf Hitler had come to power in 1933, spreading his belief that Germans were the Aryan master race, superior to all others, and that their blood should not be contaminated. He identified Jews as a race of people, not just  a religious group. German Jews were banned from marrying non-Jewish Germans and subjected  to increasing discrimination and segregation. From the time of the German takeover of Austria in 1938, Nazi brutality against Jews worsened. Jews wanting to flee German rule found other countries unwilling to accept them. 
Gathering momentum
After Germany’s invasion of Poland in 1939, the Nazi campaign against the Jews reached a terrifying new level. Herded into ghettoes, Polish Jews began to die in large numbers of starvation and ill-treatment. When Germany invaded Russia in 1941, paramilitary death squads carried out mass killings of Jews in the conquered areas. To start with, victims were shot, up to 30,000 at a time, but the SS then began gassing Jews in the backs of vans. Poison gas was found to be a more efficient way to commit mass murder. 
Until 1941, the Nazi leadership 
had envisaged solving the “Jewish problem” by deporting Jews to a distant location. By the time of the Wannsee Conference, however, they were committed to systematically killing Europe’s Jewish population. Six dedicated death camps were built in Poland. Adolf Eichmann of the Nazi paramilitary corps, the SS, arranged the transport of Jews to the camps from right across Europe, including France, Greece, Hungary, and Italy. The Jews from the Polish ghettos were also taken there to be exterminated. Prisoners arrived at these huge killing factories by train and were gassed in shower rooms, their corpses burned in large crematoria. At the Belzec camp, about half a million Jews were killed, and only seven prisoners are known to have survived. The death camp at Auschwitz, however, also had a labor camp attached, where those who were not killed on arrival were made to work. The Germans needed slave labor to support their war effort, and this offered Jews their best chance of survival.

 THE BERLIN AIRLIFT (1948)
At the Yalta and Potsdam 
conferences in 1945, the wartime Allies agreed to 
split defeated Germany into four zones, each separately administered by France, Britain, the USSR, and the US. The capital, Berlin, lay deep within Soviet-controlled East Germany. This, too, was split into four zones. On June 24, 1948, the Soviet Union imposed a blockade on West Berlin, cutting off all links by rail, road, and canal, to prevent vital supplies from reaching the population. In all, 2.5 million people faced a choice between starvation and accepting a communist regime. A clash between East and West had the potential to lead to another world war, but the Western nations devised a plan to use airplanes  to drop supplies into Berlin. Over the next 14 months, 278,288 relief missions were flown to the city.  At the height of the airlift, a plane landed every three minutes.
The Cold War 
The era of cooperation between the victors of World War II was short-lived; the Western countries clashed with the Soviet Union (USSR), over the type of governments being set up in Europe. The USSR banned non-communist parties in every Eastern European country and created a block of satellite states subservient to Soviet leadership. The Western powers sought to create democracies that excluded communists from power. Germany remained divided into communist East and democratic West, an emblem of polarized Europe. In 1946, former British prime minister Winston Churchill summed up the situation when he stated that “an iron curtain has descended across the continent.”This deep division between East and West became known as the Cold War, since it

Mohandas Gandhi 
The Indian national leader 
known as Mahatma, meaning “great soul,” Mohandas Gandhi (1869–1948) led his country to independence  
from Great Britain. He came from a Hindu family and studied law in England before spending 20 years in South Africa trying to secure rights for the Indians living there.
Gandhi’s involvement  
in Indian politics began in 1919, and he soon became the unquestioned leader of the independence movement.  
He preached the doctrine  
of Satyagraha (soul force,  
or passive resistance) which he applied against the British with great effect. He adopted a simple life believing in the virtue of small communities and campaigned against Indian industrialization. 
Gandhi’s life work was 
crowned in 1947, when India finally won independence,

to his assassination the following year by a Hindu fanatic, who blamed him for the partition of India, although Gandhi himself bitterly opposed the dismemberment of the subcontinent.

parliament where power was 
shared between Indians and British officials. This did not satisfy Indian nationalists, and the British responded to their protests with sometimes brutal repression. 
The push for independence  
from the 1920s to the 1940s  
was galvanized by the work of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. Gandhi not only launched the Satyagraha campaign, promoting non-violent protest, but also became an influential figure for millions of followers. In 1942 Gandhi led the “Quit India” campaign, calling  for civil disobedience to disrupt Britain’s efforts in World War II. The British immediately jailed Gandhi and other nationalist leaders. 
By the end of World War II, it 
was clear that Britain lacked the means to defeat the nationalist campaign. Britain’s officials in India were utterly exhausted, and Britain itself was almost bankrupt. Britain agreed to a fully independent India. While Gandhi and Nehru advocated Indian unity, the Muslim League, founded in 1906 to safeguard the rights of Muslims, demanded a completely separate Muslim state. Its leader, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, feared that Muslims could not protect their minority rights if left  
to live under Hindu rule. Congress rejected the proposal and violence on the streets between Hindus  
and Muslims began to escalate. 
Pakistan is born
In 1947, Lord Louis Mountbatten flew into Delhi as Britain’s final Viceroy of India. Faced with irreconcilable differences over the demand for a separate state for India’s Muslims, he persuaded all parties to agree to partitioning  the country into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan. 
From its birth, Pakistan faced 
many challenges. It had limited resources and a huge refugee problem. There were different traditions, cultures, and languages, and Jinnah, its first governor general, died the following year.  
In 1948, India and Pakistan fought over Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority area to remain within India. INDIAN INDEPENDENCE AND PARTITION
India’s independence was finally 
declared by Jawaharlal Nehru and  Lord Louis Mountbatten at Delhi’s Constituent Assembly, just seconds into August 15, 1947.Colonies gain freedom
After World War II, the European 
colonial powers—mainly Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Portugal—recognized that change was inevitable. Some colonies won independence by peaceful means, such as in Burma and Ceylon (1948), but often, European powers tried to hold on to their colonies. 
During World War II, Japan, itself 
a significant imperial power, drove the European powers out of Asia. After the Japanese surrender in 1945, nationalist movements in the former Asian colonies campaigned for independence rather than a return to European colonial rule.  
Dr. Ahmed Sukarno, leader of Indonesia’s nationalist movement, declared the Independent Republic of Indonesia in 1945. The Dutch sent troops to restore their authority, and in two military campaigns that followed, an estimated 150,000 Indonesians and 5,000 Dutch soldiers died. International pressure eventually forced the Dutch to concede independence in 1949.Ours is not a drive for  
power, but purely a  
non-violent fight for  
India’s independence.

Mau Mau suspects captured in 
Nairobi’s Great Rift Valley, Kenya, in 1952 are led away, with their hands on their heads, to be questioned by police and possibly held in detention camps.The Japanese occupation of Malaya 
during the war had unified the Malayan people and greatly increased nationalistic feelings. Britain clamped down on protests, which led the militant wing of the Malaysian Communist Party to declare war on the British Empire in 1948. Britain responded by declaring a state of emergency and pursuing a bitter campaign against Chinese “communist terrorists.” Independence was not granted  to Malaya until 1957. 
Unrest in Africa
In Kenya, the imposition of a state of emergency in 1952, in response to the Mau Mau (rebel) uprising,  led to greater insurgency and the British rounding up of tens of thousands of Mau Mau suspects into detention camps. By 1956 the rebellion had been crushed, but the methods used by the British to regain control brought international condemnation. In central Africa, too, decolonization was born in violence. In Rhodesia, savage conflict erupted between the black majority and the fiercely racist white leadership, which had unilaterally declared independence in 1965.The process of decolonization coincided with the new Cold War between the Soviet Union and the United States. The US became concerned that, as the European powers lost their colonies, Soviet-supported communist parties might achieve power in the new states. The US used substantial aid packages to encourage newly independent nations to adopt governments that aligned with the West. The Soviet Union deployed similar tactics in an effort to encourage new nations to join the communist bloc. Many resisted the pressure to be drawn into the Cold War and joined the “non-aligned movement.” This movement began out of a 1955 meeting in Bandung, Indonesia, involving 29 African and Asian countries. Member countries decided they would not be involved in alliances or defense pacts with the main world powers, but focus on internal development instead. 
Terrorism in France
France was determined to maintain its political status in Algeria. When independence was not realized after World War II,  war broke out between Algerian nationalists and French settlers. In 1958 the National Liberation Front (FLN), the main nationalist group, led several terrorist attacks, first in Algeria, then in Paris. The crisis led to the return to power of Charles  de Gaulle, the wartime leader of the Free French. In 1960, de Gaulle, to the horror of the French settlers, agreed to emancipate Algeria. After a long and bloody conflict in which an estimated 150,000 died, Algeria gained its independence in 1962.
Independence gained
During the 1960s and 70s, many  of the countries that were once  held as British colonies became THE MODERN WORLD
independent states and joined  the Commonwealth. The British Commonwealth, formed in 1931, became the successor to Britain’s old empire, preserving Britain’s global economic and political influence. In 1931 Britain extended dominion status to the already self-governing colonies of Canada (1867), Australia (1901), New Zealand (1907), and Newfoundland (1907). Britain and her dominions shared equal status, and they accepted the British monarch as head of the Commonwealth. In 1949 the British Commonwealth became “The Commonwealth,” a free and equal association of independent states, but the end of the empire was drawing near. Britain fought a war to retain the Falkland Islands in 1982, and Hong Kong continued as a British dependency until 1997. 
Gandhi had a profound 
influence on world politics. Other peaceful resisters—such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Tibet’s Dalai Lama—emulated his methods. Around the world, the struggle for countries to secede from nations they belong to continues, as the likes of Scotland (United Kingdom), Quebec (Canada), and Palestine fight to be seen as nations in  their own right.

struggle, of tears, of fire,  
and of blood, to the  
depths of our being.

A troubled land
Jews had immigrated to Palestine to avoid persecution in Europe since the 1880s, believing it to be the  
land promised to them by God. With the Balfour Declaration in 1917, the British government supported a Jewish homeland. The majority-Arab population objected to the settlers’ claim on their country. Facing increasing attacks, the Jews formed local defense groups under the umbrella term the Haganah. 
Escalation of violence
In 1939, the rise of anti-Semitism  in Europe, particularly in Nazi Germany, forced Jews to flee to Jerusalem. Facing a much larger influx of settlers than they had anticipated, the British proposed  a restriction on the free settlement of Jewish refugees in Palestine. 
After World War II, violence in 
Palestine escalated, and in 1947 the British government said it would terminate its rule and hand the “Palestine problem” to the United Nations. The Holocaust convinced the UN that the Jewish people needed a homeland, so they resolved to partition Palestine into an area for Arabs (about 44 percent) and the rest for a Jewish state. The Jews agreed with the plan, but the Arabs refused it. Despite this, on May 14, 1948 the state of Israel was born. 
Israel’s immediate priority was to 
build a credible defense force from the Haganah. After the Six Day War (1967), Israel controlled the Sinai, Gaza, the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and Jerusalem. It faced many attacks from Arab neighbors, in addition to threats from the paramilitary Palestine Liberation Army (PLO), formed in 1964. 
Arab Palestinians repeatedly 
called for an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza. In the occupied zones, they suffered from poor living conditions, military raids, and restricted movement.

 THE LONG MARCH (1934–1935)
In the autumn of 1933, the 
Chinese Communist Party (CCP)  was on the brink of 
annihilation. Nationalists had taken control of the country and  launched 
a major attack against their base in Jiangxi, a southeastern province.  In October 1934, the C ommunists 
were forced to abandon their stronghold and break through the Nationalist blockade. Some 80,000 set out on an extraordinary journey of 3,700 miles  (6,000km) that  lasted 
368 days. It became known as the Long March.

The Tibetan mountains, Gobi 
Desert, and miles of wilderness stood between them and their  goal: to reach the safety of  northern China and establish a  new Communist base. Hundreds  died of starvation: of the original  80,000 marchers, only about 8,000 survived. Far from being viewed as a failure, however, their feat was hailed as a triumph of endurance and ensured the survival of the CCP. 
Unifying the nation 
In 1895, China had suffered a heavy military defeat against Japan. Anti-Japanese feeling swelled following Japan’s aggression against China during World War I. Huge protests erupted after the 1919 Treaty of Versailles handed former German colonies in China to Japan. In the wake of these protests, communist ideals gained support, and in  1921 the CCP was founded. The Kuomintang, a Nationalist party, also grew and by the mid-1920s  had begun unifying the country. 
Massacre in Shanghai 
Nationalists joined forces with Communists in 1926 under Chiang Kai-shek (Jiang Jieshi) in the Northern Expedition to regain territories controlled by regional warlords. During the expedition,  as the CCP increased in strength,  a bitter rivalry led to an attack by Nationalists against the CCP in Shanghai, in April 1927. Hundreds of Communists were arrested and tortured. The massacre triggered years of anti-Communist violence, and the Communists retreated to the Jiangxi countryside. 
The struggle for survival 
After the Long March, the CCP regrouped in the north. Nationalists and Communists were forced into an uneasy alliance in 1937, when Japan invaded China. By 1939, large areas in the north and east had been conquered. After Japan’s defeat in World War II, tension between Nationalists and Communists flared up again, leading to civil war in 1946. The Communists won after massive battles with more than half a million troops on either side. On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong created the People’s Republic of China. 
The Long March was a feat  
of remarkable endurance. To the survivors, it provided a deep sense of mission and contributed to the perception of Mao as a leader of destiny and revolutionary struggle.

Chiang Kai-shek The foremost non-communist 
Chinese leader of the 20th century, Chiang Kai-shek (1887–1975) was a soldier who, in 1925, became leader of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party), which had been founded by Sun Yat-sen. 
During his various stints as 
China’s premier, he ruled over a troubled country. He attempted modest reforms but was beset  
by intractable domestic strife,  
as well as by armed conflict with Japanese invaders. 
Despite making attempts to 
crush his chief rivals, the Chinese Communists, when China was attacked by Japan his followers forced him to make an alliance with the Communists against the invading Japanese. The alliance did not survive the end of the World War II, and in 1949 Chiang and his party were driven from the mainland to the island of Formosa, which by  
that time had become known  
to Westerners as Taiwan. While he was there, Chiang set up a government in exile, which he controlled until his death in 1975. His government was recognized by many states as China’s legitimate government.

The collapse of Belgian authority in  the Congo in 1960 led to a wave  of violence across the nation and the assassination of the first prime minister, Patrick Lumumba, in 1961. Many African countries gained independence during the Cold  War. Used as pawns between  the capitalist and communist superpowers, they accepted loans and military aid: in the 1970s, Ethiopia was rewarded with billions of dollars’ worth of Soviet military equipment. Civil wars were also numerous, such as the ethnic civil wars in Rwanda and Zaire, as well as the clashes between warlords over food supplies in Somalia.
Dictatorial rulers
Once independence was achieved, African nationalist leaders sought to consolidate power by banning political rivals. Coups and military governments predominated—such as that of Idi Amin in Uganda. By the early 1970s, only Zimbabwe and South Africa were still ruled by the white political elite. Corruption, however, existed in most African countries.

of nuclear destruction. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev had deployed nuclear weapons in Cuba, and  US president John F. Kennedy demanded he remove them.  Each threatened nuclear war. This was no empty threat: from the 1950s, both superpowers had begun stockpiling vast nuclear arsenals. Strategists articulated the mutually assured destruction (MAD) doctrine, which held that if Russia attacked the West, the West would make sure that they retaliate. In short, there would be no winners.IN CONTEXT

When Kennedy became president 
in 1961, he inherited a deteriorating relationship with Cuba. The US  and Cuba had a history of mutual cooperation, but this had changed with the Cuban Revolution, when, on January 1, 1959, Fidel Castro overthrew the government of President General Fulgencio Batista. 
Trade embargo
The US accepted Castro as ruler of Cuba, in spite of his communist leanings, and had a large economic presence in Cuba. However, Castro began to break the American hold on the economy, nationalizing all industry without compensation.  In response, the US imposed a sweeping trade embargo, so  Castro turned to the Soviet Union for support. Fearing communist expansion, the US tried to topple Cuba’s government with the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961, involving CIA-backed Cuban exiles. 
Also in 1961, the US deployed  
15 nuclear-tipped Jupiter missiles in Turkey, in readiness to strike against the USSR should the need arise. Turkey shared a border with the Soviet Union, so this was viewed as a direct threat to Soviet territory. 
An ultimatum 
Khrushchev came under pressure from Soviet hard-liners to take a tough stance. This, and the desire to defend his Cuban ally from American aggression, led him to install missiles in Cuba that were capable of carrying nuclear warheads. On October 14, 1962, photographs taken by a U-2 spy plane showed nuclear weapon

When Kennedy became president 
in 1961, he inherited a deteriorating relationship with Cuba. The US  and Cuba had a history of mutual cooperation, but this had changed with the Cuban Revolution, when, on January 1, 1959, Fidel Castro overthrew the government of President General Fulgencio Batista. 
Trade embargo
The US accepted Castro as ruler of Cuba, in spite of his communist leanings, and had a large economic presence in Cuba. However, Castro began to break the American hold on the economy, nationalizing all industry without compensation.  In response, the US imposed a sweeping trade embargo, so  Castro turned to the Soviet Union for support. Fearing communist expansion, the US tried to topple Cuba’s government with the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961, involving CIA-backed Cuban exiles. 
Also in 1961, the US deployed  
15 nuclear-tipped Jupiter missiles in Turkey, in readiness to strike against the USSR should the need arise. Turkey shared a border with the Soviet Union, so this was viewed as a direct threat to Soviet territory. 
An ultimatum 
Khrushchev came under pressure from Soviet hard-liners to take a tough stance. This, and the desire to defend his Cuban ally from American aggression, led him to install missiles in Cuba that were capable of carrying nuclear warheads. On October 14, 1962, photographs taken by a U-2 spy plane showed nuclear weapon  
sites being built by the Soviets. Kennedy’s military advisers sought an immediate attack on the missile sites, but Kennedy favored a naval blockade of Cuba to prevent the installation of more missiles. He issued an ultimatum to Khrushchev to withdraw and informed the world that nuclear war was an imminent possibility. Meanwhile, Khrushchev ordered the captains of Soviet ships to hold their course for Cuban ports.

Carrying a simple radio transmitter to relay information about conditions in space, the satellite remained in orbit until January 4, 1958, when  
it re-entered and burned up in Earth’s atmosphere. 
Sputnik  symbolized far more 
than a scientific breakthrough.  
It was a sensational coup for the Soviets during the Cold War with the West. No shots were fired,  
but the military and political ramifications were immense. Americans felt more vulnerable  
to a nuclear attack. The USSR was now a Superpower, stunning the US and initiating the “space race,”  
a frantic competition between nations for technological superiority. 
The US catches up
Sputnik  was a mass-media event 
that ushered in the “Space Age,” capturing the world’s collective imagination. There was a boom  
in science-fiction books, films, and  
TV dramas set in space. By 1958,  the US had created NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, but they could only watch in envy as the Soviets sent Yuri Gagarin into orbit in 1961, the first human to go to outer space. 
The US caught up by sending 
John Glenn into orbit in 1962, and by 1967 they had built a rocket, Saturn V , that was powerful enough 
to reach the moon. In 1969, 12 years after the launch of Sputnik 1 , the 
American astronaut Neil Armstrong left Apollo 11  and became the first  
man to walk on the moon.

After French colonial rule came to an end in 1954, Vietnam was divided at the Geneva Conference into North Vietnam, with a communist government under Vietnamese communist revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh, and the US-backed South Vietnam.

Tensions steadily rose until 1964. 
In August of that year, the US Navy destroyer Maddox  was operating  
off the coast of North Vietnam in  
the Gulf of Tonkin, monitoring radar and radio from northern coastal installations, to support attacks made by the South Vietnamese navy. North Vietnam, believing the Maddox  was linked to raids on its 
coastal targets, launched a torpedo attack. Two days later, the Maddox  
reported once again coming under fire. This second attack has since been disputed, but US president Lyndon B. Johnson, recognizing that South Vietnam could not prevail on its own against a communist-led guerrilla movement that already controlled much of the country, used the skirmish to pass the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in Congress. This allowed him to take any measures necessary to deal with threats to  US forces in Southeast Asia. 
US intervention
The US feared that if Vietnam became a communist regime, other countries in the region would soon follow. Using the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, Johnson poured troops into the South and bombed North Vietnam by air. Huge numbers of civilians were killed, but despite their technological superiority, the Americans failed to crush the Viet Cong guerrillas. American troops suffered high casualties and gradually became demoralized. 
The specter of communism
The Vietnam War was the first televised war in US history. As  the public watched horrific events unfolding, an increasing number opposed the conflict. Around the world, peace movements organized large anti-war demonstrations. 
The communists’ Tet Offensive 
of 1968, a series of fierce attacks on more than 100 cities and towns in South Vietnam, crushed US hopes of an imminent end to the conflict, and peace talks were initiated in 1969. In March 1973, the last American troops withdrew from Vietnam, and in April 1975  South Vietnam fell to the North. 
US policy-makers consistently 
misinterpreted Asian nationalist movements for Soviet-inspired communism. Ultimately, however, what the US feared never came to pass, and with the exception of Laos and Cambodia, the region remained out of communist control.

Vietnam used Cambodia to channel soldiers and supplies

The military destabilization in Cambodia led to a surge of support for Pol Pot, the leader of the Kampuchean Communist Party, or Khmer Rouge, a guerrilla movement that seized power in 1975. Pol Pot’s brutal regime intended to style the country into a classless agrarian society inspired by Mao Zedong’s Cultural Revolution in China. The entire population was marched to the countryside and forced to work as rice farmers. Over the next 44 months, around 2 million people—a quarter of Cambodia’s population—died, either killed or starved. The fields where people died became known as the “Killing Fields”. After three years of terror, Pol Pot was driven from power by  
a Vietnamese invasion.

of Castro’s fighter planes survived. The next day, Castro’s air force sank two ships loaded with vital supplies. In the early hours of April 17, a group of around 1,400 Cuban exiles, codenamed Brigade 2506, launched an amphibious assault on the coast of southern Cuba, the Bay of Pigs. They were driven back by Castro’s forces and ran out of ammunition.  It only took three days to thwart  the exiles’ invasion. IN CONTEXT

Castro must go
After World War II, Latin America 
became a proxy battleground for two competing ideological systems: capitalism and communism. The  
US was determined to eradicate communism and supported right-wing dictators with anti-reformist regimes in countries such as Cuba, Honduras, and Guatemala. 
During the 1950s, corruption  
and brutality within the Cuban Batista government forced a slow withdrawal of US support. When Castro defeated Batista in 1959,  the US government had misgivings over Castro’s communist leanings. By 1960, Castro had nationalized  all US interests in Cuba without compensation and had broken diplomatic ties. To protect their economic assets and defeat communism, US policy-makers decided that Castro must go. 
Within a year of Castro  
taking power, several counter-revolutionary groups were formed by Cuban exiles in Miami. The American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) took an interest  in these groups, providing them with training and equipment to topple the Cuban government. The failure at the Bay of Pigs was largely down to poor planning and President Kennedy’s reluctance to become too involved. 
Pro-Cuba demonstrations
Castro forged a closer alliance with the Soviet Union, its ally against American aggression, enabling him to export his ideals across Latin America. The invasion incited  pro-Cuba anti-US demonstrations from Chile to Mexico. Castro actively supported guerrilla warfare, and thousands of Latin American guerrillas went to Cuba for training. The revolution in Cuba inspired similar uprisings through the 1960s and 70s in Nicaragua, Brazil, Uruguay, and Venezuela, where there was disaffection with illiteracy, inequality, and poverty. 
Latin America continued to 
preoccupy US foreign policy. The US intervened several times in an effort to contain communism. They supported military coups in Chile in 1973 and Argentina in 1976 and, fearing a communist takeover, funded the El Salvadoran military in the late 1970s to prop up their regime. In 1983, the US invaded Grenada; and in 1989, Panama. 
■Fidel Castro
To his supporters, Fidel Castro 
(b.1926) was a revolutionary hero who stood up to the US. To his detractors, he was a dictator whose close ties with the Soviet Union brought the world close to nuclear war.
Jailed as a student in 1953 
for his revolutionary activities, Castro was released two years later and went into exile in the US and Mexico. He returned  
to Cuba in 1956 with a small guerrilla band, among them the Argentine Marxist revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara, and set to work undermining the regime of the dictator Batista. On January 1, 1959, he assumed absolute power. Castro was determined to improve literacy, offered free healthcare, and instituted land reforms. 
Castro saw himself as a 
leader of the world’s oppressed people and helped train anti-Apartheid forces in South Africa. In the 1970s, he sent troops to support communist forces in Angola, Ethiopia,  
and Yemen. 
In 2008, wracked by ill 
health, Castro stood down  
as president of Cuba, leaving power in the hands of his brother Raúl. 
Cuba must not  
be abandoned to  
the communists.

Castro forged a closer alliance with the Soviet Union, its ally against American aggression, enabling him to export his ideals across Latin America. The invasion incited  pro-Cuba anti-US demonstrations from Chile to Mexico. Castro actively supported guerrilla warfare, and thousands of Latin American guerrillas went to Cuba for training. The revolution in Cuba inspired similar uprisings through the 1960s and 70s in Nicaragua, Brazil, Uruguay, and Venezuela, where there was disaffection with illiteracy, inequality, and poverty. 
Latin America continued to 
preoccupy US foreign policy. The US intervened several times in an effort to contain communism. They supported military coups in Chile in 1973 and Argentina in 1976 and, fearing a communist takeover, funded the El Salvadoran military in the late 1970s to prop up their regime. In 1983, the US invaded Grenada; and in 1989, Panama. 
■Fidel Castro
To his supporters, Fidel Castro 
(b.1926) was a revolutionary hero who stood up to the US. To his detractors, he was a dictator whose close ties with the Soviet Union brought the world close to nuclear war.
Jailed as a student in 1953 
for his revolutionary activities, Castro was released two years later and went into exile in the US and Mexico. He returned  
to Cuba in 1956 with a small guerrilla band, among them the Argentine Marxist revolutionary Ernesto “Che” Guevara, and set to work undermining the regime of the dictator Batista. On January 1, 1959, he assumed absolute power. Castro was determined to improve literacy, offered free healthcare, and instituted land reforms. 
Castro saw himself as a 
leader of the world’s oppressed people and helped train anti-Apartheid forces in South Africa. In the 1970s, he sent troops to support communist forces in Angola, Ethiopia,  
and Yemen. 
In 2008, wracked by ill 
health, Castro stood down  
as president of Cuba, leaving power in the hands of his brother Raúl. 
Cuba must not  
be abandoned to  
the communists.

The Cultural Revolution was 
one of the darkest periods in Chinese history. Since 
taking power in 1949, C ommunist 
Party leader Mao Zedong had neither created his ideal China nor secured his power. To bolster his primacy and ignite revolutionary fervor, Mao decided to purge any opposition and transform capitalists and intellectuals into proletarians –  
ordinary workers . He ordered the 
Cultural Revolution, which would attack the “Four Olds”: old ideas, old habits, old customs, and old culture. Squads of young communists, incited by Mao and known as the Red Guards, terrorized intellectuals, IN CONTEXT

36 million people were persecuted, and up to a million died in the turmoil, which lasted until 1976. 
The Great Leap Forward
After creating the Chinese People’s Republic in 1949, Mao launched reforms to transform China’s semi-feudal, mostly agricultural society into an industrialized socialist state. In the late 1950s, in a bid to achieve rapid economic growth, Mao ordered the Great Leap Forward. Industrial output climbed with steel and coal production, the rail network doubled, and more than half of all Chinese land was irrigated by 1961. 
However, this development came 
at a terrible cost. Mao transformed rural China into a series of farming communes in which villagers pooled land, animals, tools, and crops. The authorities took vast amounts of grain from the communes to feed city workers, and this, along with  a series of natural disasters, led  to famine and starvation. The consequences were staggering: an estimated 45 million people died. 
A new foreign policy
After the Cultural Revolution, Mao needed American expertise to restore China, and the US wanted an ally against the Soviet Union. In 1972, US President Richard Nixon traveled to Peking to meet with Mao. By the time Mao died in 1976, China had become a major oil producer with nuclear capabilities. 
Deng Xiaoping, who led China 
from 1978 to 1997, was willing to use capitalist ideas to focus on economic growth. But while he initiated new and far-reaching measures, such as inviting foreign firms to invest in Chinese industry and supporting developing technologies, he  
also resisted pressure to make democratic reforms. 
By the beginning of the new 
millennium, China’s economic growth was spectacular. In 2001, the country was admitted to the World Trade Organization, and in 2008 it played host to the Olympic Games in Beijing. Some economists predict that by 2026 China will boast a gross domestic product (GDP) greater than Japan and Western Europe.
After Mao’s death, the Chinese 
Communist Party condemned  the Cultural Revolution as a disaster. However, as the country experienced a period of unparalleled economic growth, a sense of nostalgia for Mao’s ideals, focused on the people and self-sufficiency, grew among farmers and members of the urban working class. Today, Mao’s legacy continues to cast a long shadow over a modernizing China.

 THE SUEZ CRISIS (1956)
On July 26, 1956, Egyptian 
leader, Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser, addressed  
a crowd in the city of Alexandria, declaring the nationalization of the Suez Canal, the waterway through which most oil bound for Western Europe had to pass. For Egyptians, the nationalization symbolized the liberation of their country from the British imperialist dominance it  
had been under since the 1880s. In response to Nasser’s bold move, a secret plan was hatched by Britain, France, and Israel. France was eager for Nasser’s downfall because of  
his support for Algerian insurgents against French colonial rule in Algeria. Israel had many reasons for IN CONTEXT

Splitting the land
The strong anti-Western sentiment in the Middle East dates back hundreds of years, fueled by the West’s increased involvement in the region. Colonialism in the 1800s  and the division of the Ottoman Empire after World War I were bitter humiliations for peoples who felt their religion, Islam, was the highest form of divine revelation. In 1948, the partition of Palestine to form Israel spilt the land into two states, one Arab and one Jewish, and was rejected vehemently by Israeli Arabs and enraged the other Arab nations. The regular armies of the Arab states—including Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Transjordan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Egypt—attacked Israel in the first Arab–Israeli War in May and June 1948. The war ended in defeat for the Arabs and disaster for the Palestinians: more than half of the country’s Arabs were uprooted as refugees, and they lost any possibility of a state of their own.

because of Nasser’s association 
with the Soviets and his unceasing diatribes against the West. Nasser felt insulted and immediately nationalized the Suez Canal. The move was popular in Egypt, as the canal was a source of Arab pride. 
Nasser was a secular modernizer 
who advocated the separation of religion from political life, believing it the hallmark of Arab modernity, but this was not universally welcomed. The Muslim Brotherhood, founded in Egypt in 1928, argued for Islam to have a central role in government. After repeated calls for the application of Sharia law—a legal system based on Islam—and an assassination attempt against Nasser, the organization was finally banned in 1954. 
In 1967, Arab countries suffered 
a crushing defeat at the hands  
of Israel in the Six Day War, in which Israel took the Sinai from Egypt, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, meaning Israel was now an occupier. In the 1970s and 80s, the Arab–Israeli conflict largely moved in the direction of peace: in 1979 the Israeli–Egypt peace deal ended 30 years of war. The rise of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLO) and of other Palestinian groups attacking Israel, however, as well  
as Israel’s invasion of Lebanon in 1982, where many of the PLO were grouped, destabilized of the fragile peace continuously. 
The Iran–Iraq War
Like many countries in the Middle East, modern Iraq was carved out of the ruins of the Ottoman Empire in the aftermath of World War I. Iraq was a land divided along ethnic lines between Arabs and Kurds,  
as well as sectarian lines between Sunni and Shia Muslims, the latter being the majority group. Saddam Hussein, a Sunni, became leader in 1979, and suppressed ethnic Kurds and Shias alike using immense brutality. He, like Nasser in Egypt, espoused Arab nationalism and ruled Iraq as a secular state. 
In 1979, events in Iran inspired 
Islamists throughout the Middle East. The secular, Western way of life was swept away in an Islamic revolution in which the US-backed Shah was ousted. The new regime, under Ayatollah Khomeini, a Shia Muslim, based its laws and ideology on the strict teachings of the Koran. Saddam felt threatened by the Islamic revolution and a possible Shia uprising in his own country, so he invaded Iran on September  22, 1980 under the pretext of a territorial dispute over the Shatt al-Arab, a waterway that lies between the  
two countries. 
The invasion triggered a bruising 
eight-year war that devastated both countries and increased tensions  
in the Middle East. Iran’s principal ally was Syria, but Libya, China, and North Korea all also sent it weapons. Iraq’s support came mostly from  
the Arab Gulf states, which viewed Iran as the greater danger to their security; Saudi Arabia and Kuwait THE SUEZ CRISIS

provided billions of dollars in loans. 
Ultimately, Iran was defeated; and Iraq, now awash with armaments supplied by several Western nations, including Britain, France, and the United States, invaded the oil-rich state of Kuwait in 1990. The UN demanded their withdrawal, but Saddam announced that Kuwait had been annexed by Iraq. The United States, with support from coalition forces, sent in troops during the First Gulf War (1990–91) and toppled Saddam from power. 
The 9/11 attacks
The continued US support of Israel led to profound grievances among Islamists. To them, the capitalist, secular US, with its greed for oil, symbolized all that was wrong with the West, and terrorist strikes on US targets grew. Al-Qaeda carried out the most shocking on September 11, 2001, against four targets in the United States, including the World Trade Center in New York City. 
In response to the 9/11 attacks, 
a successful US-led international intervention brought down the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which the US believed had given sanctuary to Osama bin Laden and 
US_318-321_Suez_Crisis.indd   320 15/02/2016   16:45321
al-Qaeda. After September 11, President Bush declared a “War  on Terror” and, in 2002, with help from the British government, attacked Iraq on the premise of destroying “weapons of mass destruction” (WMDs) deemed a threat to national security. Western intervention in the Muslim world heightened the belief among Islamists that the West was the enemy of Islam.
The Arab Spring
The 9/11 attacks were inspired by  a radical ideology and belief that the fundamental problems plaguing Arab and Muslim people could  be resolved by attacking foreign powers that were seen to oppress Islam. In 2011, young Arabs—looking inward to promote change and blaming their own leaders for decades of political, economic, and cultural decline—were at the heart of uprisings across the Arab world. At its core, what became known  
as the Arab Spring was a new generation’s attempt to change the state order. An extraordinary series of pro-democracy uprisings, the Arab Spring caused huge upheavals in the Middle East and North Africa. It started in Tunisia on December 17, 2010 when a street vendor set himself on fire in a protest against police brutality. Protestors throughout Tunisia demanded democracy, and President Zine el Abidine fled the country on 14 January. Disorder spread from Tunisia to Algeria, where there  was unrest over lack of jobs. 
On January 25, thousands of 
protestors took to the streets in Egypt, and after 18 days of protests there, President Hosni Mubarak resigned. By mid-February, civil unrest had swept through Bahrain, where it was brutally suppressed, and into Libya. Muammar Gaddafi’s violent response to the dissidents led to civil war. An international coalition led by NATO launched a campaign of air strikes targeting Gaddafi’s forces, and he was killed in October 2011. 
Further uprisings occurred in 
Jordan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia, but the worst violence against civilians was seen in Syria, where President Bashar Assad promised reforms but used force to crush  
the dissent—a move that merely hardened the protestors’ resolve. In July 2011, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets, and the

Capitalizing on the chaos in the region, so-called Islamic State (also referred to as IS, ISIS, or ISIL), the extremist Muslim group that replaced al-Qaeda, took control of huge swathes of territory across northern and eastern Syria, as well as neighboring Iraq. 
Middle East instability
The Suez Crisis was the end of  
one era in the politics of the  
Middle East and the start of another. It marked the humiliating end of imperial influence for two European countries, Britain and France, whose role was soon  
taken over by the US. It stimulated Arab nationalism and opened an era of Arab-Israeli wars and Palestinian terrorism. 
In modern times, the Middle 
East has never seemed so unstable. Wars are being fought over religion, ethnicity, territory, politics, and commerce, and these conflicts have led to the worst refugee crisis since World War II, with millions fleeing anarchy and fanaticism.

Terrorism in the Middle East
Since the mid-20th century, 
terrorism has been synonymous with the Middle East. The Israel–Palestine conflict is one  
of the world’s most challenging. 
In 1964, Arab leaders  
formed the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), declaring Israel’s establishment illegal. The PLO used terrorism to attack Israel and Western targets for their support of Israel. In 1970, Palestinian militants blew up three hijacked planes in the Jordanian desert, and in 1972 a group linked to the PLO hit the Israeli Olympic team during the games in Munich, Germany. 
In 1983, Hezbollah, an Iran-  
backed fundamentalist Shiite Muslim group in Lebanon, blew up the Beirut barracks of both US Marine and French forces, killing 298 people. Hezbollah pioneered the use of suicide bombers in the Middle East. 
Both Jews and Muslims have 
employed terrorism to derail the many attempts that have been made at peace in the region.

one era in the politics of the  
Middle East and the start of another. It marked the humiliating end of imperial influence for two European countries, Britain and France, whose role was soon  
taken over by the US. It stimulated Arab nationalism and opened an era of Arab-Israeli wars and Palestinian terrorism. 
In modern times, the Middle 
East has never seemed so unstable. Wars are being fought over religion, ethnicity, territory, politics, and commerce, and these conflicts have led to the worst refugee crisis since World War II, with millions fleeing anarchy and fanaticism. 
■We shall not be satisfied 
except by the final obliteration 
of Israel from the map of  
the Middle East.

Terrorism in the Middle East
Since the mid-20th century, 
terrorism has been synonymous with the Middle East. The Israel–Palestine conflict is one  
of the world’s most challenging. 
In 1964, Arab leaders  
formed the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), declaring Israel’s establishment illegal. The PLO used terrorism to attack Israel and Western targets for their support of Israel. In 1970, Palestinian militants blew up three hijacked planes in the Jordanian desert, and in 1972 a group linked to the PLO hit the Israeli Olympic team during the games in Munich, Germany. 
In 1983, Hezbollah, an Iran-  
backed fundamentalist Shiite Muslim group in Lebanon, blew up the Beirut barracks of both US Marine and French forces, killing 298 people. Hezbollah pioneered the use of suicide bombers in the Middle East. 
Both Jews and Muslims have 
employed terrorism to derail the many attempts that have been made at peace in the region.

 THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL ( 1989 )
For decades, the Berlin  
Wall, which separated  East and West Berlin,  
stood as a reminder of the Cold War, the bitter division between Soviet communism and Western capitalism. On November 9, 1989, the East German government lifted travel restrictions, and thousands  of people began converging at  the wall. East German border guards yielded in the face of ecstatic crowds. On November 10,  in extraordinary scenes, soldiers from both sides helped Berliners break through the wall. Over the next two days, more than 3 million people crossed the border. IN CONTEXT

Ruling the Eastern Bloc
At the end of World War II, the USSR 
had banned anti-communist parties in every Eastern European country, and created a bloc of satellite states under Soviet leadership, ruthlessly suppressing any opposition. In  
the fall of 1956, Hungary rose against its communist government, only to be crushed by Soviet tanks, and in 1968, the USSR invaded Czechoslovakia to remove a government it found too liberal. 
In the 1960s, Germany was still 
divided between East and West, and its former capital Berlin split into the Allied-operated West and the Soviet-controlled East. Each had its own German administration: democratic in the West, communist in the East. Thousands of East Germans escaped to the West,  and the country hemorrhaged  its skilled workers. On August 13, 1961, the government sealed off East from West Berlin with a fence, which, over time, became a heavily fortified barrier dividing the city, the nation, and family and friends. 
In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev  
was appointed as General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party. Aiming for warmer relations with the West, he set out new reforms: 
glasnost  (political “openness”)  
and perestroika  (liberal economic 
“restructuring”). Critically, he lifted the ban on Eastern Bloc countries reforming their political systems. 
Collapse of communism 
With the threat of Soviet military intervention removed, citizens in all Eastern Bloc countries protested to end communist rule. In June 1989, Poland’s Solidarity, originally a banned trade union, was elected to lead a coalition government. As the push for reform gathered pace, the East German government declared that its citizens would be able to visit West Berlin through any border crossing, including the Berlin Wall. 
The fall of the Berlin Wall was  
a momentous event. It marked an era that saw the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It allowed millions to travel more freely, and previously stifled economies across Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union opened up to the world. Many former communist countries were welcomed into NATO and joined the European Union. 
The world changed course in 
1989. Communism was dead in  
the East, and a reunified Germany was about to take its place at the heart of Europe.

The break-up of the Soviet Union
In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev 
became leader of a stagnating Soviet Union. He laid out  
radical reforms— glasnost  and 
perestroika —and in July 1989  
he announced that countries within the Warsaw Pact could hold openly contested elections. Poles, Czechs, Hungarians, and others opted for democratic governments, destabilizing the Soviet Union itself. 
In July 1991, the anti-
communist Boris Yeltsin was elected president of Russia. A month later, with Gorbachev weakened by an attempted coup by hardline communists, Yeltsin took advantage. He banned the Communist Party in Russia and met secretly with the leaders  
of Ukraine and Belarus, who agreed to secede from the  
Soviet Union. On Christmas  
Day 1991, Gorbachev resigned, leaving Yeltsin as president  
of the new Russian state. The former empire split into 15 new independent states, and the USSR was no more.

over poor campus facilities at Nanterre University in a suburb 
of Paris, France, spread across the country. In March, riot police were called to deal with the unrest, and hundreds of students descended on Nanterre. By May, the uprising had moved to the center of Paris, and the number of protestors swelled to thousands. Tension erupted on the streets, as demonstrators called for revolutionary social change and the collapse of the government. Within a few days, 8 million workers went on a wildcat strike that brought France to a standstill. 
A momentous year
France’s journey to near revolution is the defining event of 1968, a year of global protest. Much was against the Vietnam War, but many people also marched against oppressive regimes. Politics became more radical: the “coming out” of sexual minorities, women’s liberation, and sexual equality came to the fore. In the United States, groups such as the Black Panthers fought for racial equality; and the German Student Movement, led by Rudi Dutschke, opposed the older generation, who had been part of World War II. 
The French protests lost steam 
as elections showed overwhelming support for the government. The revolutionary movements of 1968 ultimately failed, but they inspired a generation to question authority. In their wake came a rise in left-wing terrorist groups that used bombing and kidnapping while purporting  to fight for social justice.

The fall of the Berlin Wall 322–23The Siege of Sarajevo, 
Bosnia, was one of the most appalling tragedies  
in Yugoslavia’s civil war (1991–2002). During the 44-month siege, the city’s food and electricity supplies were cut off, and the civilian population was bombarded by nationalist Bosnian Serbs. Thousands of Bosnian Muslims were targeted and murdered. 
A new wave of nationalism 
Yugoslavia was comprised of  
six socialist republics: Croatia, Montenegro, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Serbia, each with its own prime minister and constitution. Overall power in Yugoslavia was held by a president, notably communist leader Josip Broz Tito from 1953 to 1980. 
After the 1991 break-up of the 
Soviet Union, a nationalist revival swept Eastern Europe. Croatia and Slovenia’s call for independence was opposed by Serbia, and Vukovar, in eastern Croatia, was destroyed by the Yugoslav army under Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic. When Bosnia also declared independence in 1992, the violence intensified. Bosnian Serbs aimed to create  a separate ethnically pure Serbian state, the Republika Srpska, carving it from the new Republic  
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Nationalist Bosnian Serbs, supported by neighboring Serbia, launched a campaign to expel non-Serbs, and during the Siege of Sarajevo, they targeted the majority Bosnian Muslim population. 
The Bosnian War ended in 1995, 
but fighting continued in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians began a separatist movement against the Serbs. Ethnically based nationalism also led to bloody anti-Armenian pogroms in the Nagorno-Karabakh region and in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. In Georgia, violence erupted between the Georgian and Abkhazian population. 
The wars in Yugoslavia forced 
the issue of the global community’s responsibility to resolve disputes that threaten wider instability  
or cause unacceptable human suffering or rights violations.

The seeds of extremism
September 11 was not the first terror attack on American soil by Islamic extremists. On February 26, 1993, a bomb was detonated at the World Trade Center by men thought to have links to al-Qaeda, a militant Islamist organization. Some Muslims had been radicalized and adopted international terrorism during the struggles over Israel.  In 1979, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan led to the worldwide mobilization of Muslim militants to fight the invaders. Around that time, Osama Bin Laden formed al-Qaeda. Intelligence reports suggested that he was the mastermind behind September 11. He was killed in 2011. The civil war in Syria since 2011 and the power vacuum left by the departure of US forces in Iraq has led to the emergence of ISIS, the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, which has taken control of several towns in the region. 
The events of September 11 
mark the largest terrorist attack ever on US soil. Subsequent attacks in London, Madrid, and Paris, carried out by a diffuse network of regional terrorist groups, have added a chilling dimension to the threat of

persuaded CERN that the World Wide Web should be given to the world as a free resource. 
Although it revolutionized the 
computer and communications world like nothing before, the World Wide Web was only possible by bringing together several existing technologies: the telephone, television, radio, and Internet. 
The Internet

FINANCIAL SYSTEM  
 CLOSE TO COLLAPSE
 THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS ( 2008 )
The turn of the 21st century 
brought troubling signs  of a worldwide recession. 
Low interest rates and unregulated credit had induced more and more people to get into unsustainable debts. Bankers, particularly in the US, offered mortgages to customers with a poor credit history. These mortgages were called “subprime mortgages”. It was hoped that if people could not keep up with their mortgage payments, their houses could be repossessed and sold at a profit, but this depended on house prices rising. In 2007, interest rates crept up, and house prices fell. People began defaulting on their monthly repayments. Across the US, IN CONTEXT

packages to boost their economies. 
They increased government spending and decreased taxes. Others, especially in Europe,  
opted for austerity, freezing public spending, and increasing taxes. Protests and strikes swept through Europe in response to these measures. Portugal, Spain, and Greece came under pressure from the European Union (EU) to lower their debts. The EU spent billions propping up weak economies in an attempt to keep the Eurozone, and the euro, viable. But the effect of the economic crisis was devastating, and many people lost their homes and jobs. It was the worst economic downturn since World War II.
Post-war economy
After World War II, most of Europe, Japan, China, and the Soviet Union, all devastated by war, needed  
time to recover. The US, which  
had experienced a huge rise in manufacturing for the war effort and was spared destruction, continued manufacturing at  
higher levels than ever before and dominated the world economy.  
The post-war economic planners sought a new economic order  
based on industrial strength  and a stable dollar. In 1944, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was formed to foster the revival of global trade. The US’s strong post-war economy and the Marshall  Plan of 1947, a US-led initiative to aid Western countries, invigorated world trade through encouraging capitalism and the free exchange  of goods between nations. Signed in 1947, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) dictated that tariffs be removed to open up markets around the world.
The Asian tiger
Japan, meanwhile, saw massive economic growth. The Japanese government implemented reforms based on efficiency and restricted foreign imports. They did not  sign up to the GATT agreement until 1955. Japan invested in its coal and steel industries, as well as shipbuilding and car manufacturing. In the 1960s, Japan specialized in high-tech products such as cameras and computer chips. Countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia experienced similar growth with an emphasis on electronics and technology. These successes became collectively known as “Asian tiger economics.” THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS
The role of oil
By the 1970s, the world was divided between rich industrial countries and poor developing nations, and oil had become increasingly important. In 1960, the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq, and Iran, was founded. As oil reserves in other countries dwindled, the states around the Persian Gulf, where this resource had remained plentiful, became dominant. In October 1973, when Egypt and Syria invaded Israel during the Yom Kippur War, OAPEC embargoed oil to any country helping Israel, and prices tripled. Without oil, industrial output dropped. The United States introduced strict fuel rationing, which ended in March 1974, when the oil embargo was lifted. 
A new economic model
The oil crisis in the mid-1970s led to a deep global recession, soaring inflation, and high unemployment. In response, a new “neo-liberal” economic policy was adopted, transferring control of economic factors from the public to the private sector. Welfare programs were perceived to be one cause of economic failures, and there were drastic cutbacks. Deregulation became the driving force behind world economics, sweeping away many governmental controls and freeing up organizations to trade across a wider range of territories. The need for this was particularly felt in the United States, which faced stiff competition from a  world now fully rebuilt from the The oil crisis that struck Western 
countries in 1973–74 was the result  of the Yom Kippur War. Fuel rationing in the US led to scenes such as this, with motorists getting stranded.

destruction of World War II. Some of 
the rigid laws and regulations that had been put in place to protect consumers were now considered to be interfering with free enterprise. 
The global push for deregulation 
resulted in the adoption of new markets, greater competition, and openness, especially as the world adapted to the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union. The example set in east Asia influenced policy makers in other Asian countries, such as India and China. Mexico and Brazil lowered their barriers to trade and embarked on economic reform, leading to a dramatic improvement in living standards. As East and West Germany reunited in 1989, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the European Union (EU), an economic union of 28 European countries, emerged as a major force in the world economy. Also in the 1980s, China opened  up to foreign trade, and huge sums of foreign investment poured in, leading to extraordinary growth. 
Global economy
The world economy is now far more open. Internet use allows people to order goods in one part of the world and have them delivered elsewhere within a matter of days. World trade is made up of global partnerships, with multinational companies that boast huge turnovers. Across the globe, people tend to migrate to cities to find work, resulting in  
an increase in urbanization. 
One complaint that is often 
aimed at globalization is that some companies exploit cheap labor and behave unethically in their bid for profit. Another is that globalization has contributed to the extraordinary accumulation of wealth by a few THE MODERN WORLD
individuals and, thus, increased inequality. Some countries have also remained extremely poor—areas of sub-Saharan Africa, for example have fared badly and been left behind, in debt to wealthier nations. 
Economic recessions have 
occurred throughout history, but the financial crisis of 2008–11 was the worst—at least since the Great Depression of 1929—and maybe  
the worst ever. Many felt it was  
an avoidable disaster caused by widespread failures in government regulation and heedless risk-taking by investment bankers. Only massive monetary and fiscal stimuli prevented catastrophe. Household and business debts remained high, and there was widespread fury directed at bankers, whom many felt had survived relatively unscathed. Austerity measures provoked civil unrest. Demonstrations were held against capitalism; the Occupy Movement spread, with tens of thousands marching in New York, London, Frankfurt, Madrid, Rome, Sydney, and Hong Kong. While financiers argued over the causes of the Global Recession, the impact  on the lives of ordinary people had profound, lasting consequences.

The global economic crisis that 
began in 2008 generated much anger at institutional symbols of power and greed, and there was an upsurge of popular protest. Demonstrations united those venting at bankers and capitalists, anti-globalization protestors, and environmentalists. There was growing anger at the level of inequality, corporate greed,  
and the lack of jobs. 
When the G20, an international

in the financial heart of London  in 2009, they were faced with thousands of angry protestors. Social media became critical  
in the organization of large gatherings and the occupation of physical spaces. As protests spread throughout Europe, they used the banner of “Occupy,”  
a movement set up in New York to protest against social and economic inequality. There were riots in Rome, strikes in Greece, demonstrations in Portugal,  
and occupations in the public squares of Barcelona, Moscow, Madrid, New York, Chicago,  
and Istanbul. 
People took to the streets to 
protest against the actions of banks and multinationals, which were seen as the trigger of the financial crisis.

On October 31, 2011, a baby 
girl born in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, 
was chosen by the United Nations (UN) to symbolically represent  
the 7 billionth person on earth.  
To mark this global-population milestone, October 31st was named Seven Billion Day, but with a billion people reported to be going hungry at that time, debates were rekindled about whether the Earth could support so many people. 
Before the 17th century, the 
world’s population increased very slowly, but it began to expand rapidly after 1850. This was in part due to a reduction in the number  
of children dying in infancy, but death rates fell overall, too, as new farming technology expanded the food supply and lowered the risk  
of famine. The marked increase  
of industrialization and advances  
in medicine improved public health and living standards.
By 1927, the world-population 
figure had reached 2 billion. In the early 20th century, population growth was highest in the rich industrialized West, but this pattern began to change. Mid-century saw many European countries experience falling birth rates, while population growth increased sharply in the relatively underdeveloped areas of Asia, Africa, and South America due to a much higher birth rate. In 1987, the 5 billionth person was born; and by 1999, the 6 billionth. It took 123 years for the world’s population to go from 1 billion to 2 billion but had taken only 12 years to make the leap from 6 billion to 7 billion. 
The Green Revolution
During the early 20th century,  
many countries imported large quantities of food that they were unable to grow themselves, to enable them to meet the demands of a growing population. Britain,  
for example, imported 55 million tons of food each year. 
In the early 1940s, Mexico 
imported half of its wheat, and its population was rapidly expanding. The country requested technical expertise from the United States on ways to increase wheat production. By 1944, with the financial support of the American Rockefeller Foundation, a group of US scientists, including American biochemist Norman Borlaug, had begun GLOBAL POPULATION EXCEEDS 7 BILLION

birth rates stay high.
1959  The approximately

on July 11, inspired by the interest in the symbolic 5 billionth baby.
AFTER
2050  Global population is set 
to hit 9.7 billion, a slowdown in growth, with fewer babies born per household. 
2100  Estimates suggest that 
the world population will be 
over 11 billion, posing grave challenges for food supplies. 
Living longer
During the 20th century, life 
expectancy rose dramatically. In 2013, the average life expectancy worldwide, from birth, was 71.0 years. Health education, which focused on diet and basic hygiene, led to a reduction in infant mortality, and better sanitation and clean drinking water have reduced the risks of spreading infectious diseases, including cholera and typhoid. 
One of the biggest 
contributory factors to longer life expectancy has been the eradication of some killer diseases. The antibiotic drug penicillin, which helps fight bacterial infection, became widely used to treat diseases such as tuberculosis and syphilis. Later, mass vaccination programs by governments and the United Nations’ World Health Organization (WHO) helped eradicate smallpox and work toward the elimination of polio. Advances in medicine and diagnostics have revolutionized healthcare. Some scientists predict that by 2050, the average life expectancy will be 100.

researching methods of developing 
a high-yielding strain of wheat that could resist disease and was short in height, so as to reduce wind damage. The work in Mexico was incredibly successful: by 1956, the country was totally self-sufficient and no longer imported wheat and maize. This success launched  what became known as the Green Revolution—the spread of new modern agricultural technologies in the 1960s and 70s that dramatically increased food production around the world. The Green Revolution benefited countries that included the Philippines, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, China, Indonesia, Kenya, Iran, Thailand, and Turkey.
Indian scientists in particular 
had followed the work of Borlaug and his colleagues. In the mid-1960s, India had been struck by two back-to-back droughts, which led to the need for large food imports from the United States. In 1964, both India and Pakistan began importing and testing semi-dwarf varieties of wheat from Mexico, and the results were promising: in the spring of 1966, the harvest was larger than any ever produced in South Asia, despite it being a dry year. 
Miracle rice
In 1960, a new so-called miracle rice known as IR-8 was developed at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. With  its much reduced growing cycle,  this new product brought about a dramatic transformation in farmers’ lives. In countries such as Vietnam, two complete crops of the new  rice could now be produced each year, whereas the traditional rice  it replaced would only produce one crop. Stunning innovations such as this in agricultural science allowed chronically poor countries, in Asia in particular, to feed themselves and meet the demands of their growing populations. 
The Green Revolution did not 
come without controversy, not  least because it involved a move toward chemical pesticides. During the 1940s, the insecticide DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) was introduced as a way of controlling a variety of diseases, including mosquito-borne malaria, with a single treatment. However in 1962, American biologist Rachel Carson highlighted the dangers of DDT in her groundbreaking book Silent Spring , claiming that it may cause cancer and also be bad for the environment. Silent Spring  led 
to a nationwide ban on DDT in the US and raised enough concern  to trigger the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an independent body to safeguard the environment. The Green Revolution also faced huge challenges in many countries in Africa, where there was a lack of irrigation facilities, unreliable rainfall, high fertilizer prices, and no credit to buy new seed varieties.

researching methods of developing 
a high-yielding strain of wheat that could resist disease and was short in height, so as to reduce wind damage. The work in Mexico was incredibly successful: by 1956, the country was totally self-sufficient and no longer imported wheat and maize. This success launched  what became known as the Green Revolution—the spread of new modern agricultural technologies in the 1960s and 70s that dramatically increased food production around the world. The Green Revolution benefited countries that included the Philippines, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, China, Indonesia, Kenya, Iran, Thailand, and Turkey.
Indian scientists in particular 
had followed the work of Borlaug and his colleagues. In the mid-1960s, India had been struck by two back-to-back droughts, which led to the need for large food imports from the United States. In 1964, both India and Pakistan began importing and testing semi-dwarf varieties of wheat from Mexico, and the results were promising: in the spring of 1966, the harvest was larger than any ever produced in South Asia, despite it being a dry year. 
Miracle rice
In 1960, a new so-called miracle rice known as IR-8 was developed at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. With  its much reduced growing cycle,  this new product brought about a dramatic transformation in farmers’ lives. In countries such as Vietnam, two complete crops of the new  rice could now be produced each year, whereas the traditional rice  it replaced would only produce one crop. Stunning innovations such as this in agricultural science allowed chronically poor countries, in Asia in particular, to feed themselves and meet the demands of their growing populations. 
The Green Revolution did not 
come without controversy, not  least because it involved a move toward chemical pesticides. During the 1940s, the insecticide DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane) was introduced as a way of controlling a variety of diseases, including mosquito-borne malaria, with a single treatment. However in 1962, American biologist Rachel Carson highlighted the dangers of DDT in her groundbreaking book Silent Spring , claiming that it may cause cancer and also be bad for the environment. Silent Spring  led 
to a nationwide ban on DDT in the US and raised enough concern  to trigger the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an independent body to safeguard the environment. The Green Revolution also faced huge challenges in many countries in Africa, where there was a lack of irrigation facilities, unreliable rainfall, high fertilizer prices, and no credit to buy new seed varieties.

Second Green Revolution, but this, 
too, proved controversial. GM crops are foods produced from organisms that have had changes added into their DNA via genetic engineering. They were introduced in America  
in 1994 when the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved  
the Flavr Savr tomato for sale. The delayed-ripening tomato had a longer shelf-life than conventional tomatoes, but trials using potatoes suggested that GM produce was toxic to rats. Most European Union (EU) governments banned the use of GM crops, while supporters of GM suggested that without genetic intervention, the world was destined to starve. Advocates of GM—notably the US, Brazil, Canada, Argentina, and Australia—believe it has the potential to combat disease and hunger. The feeling in Europe, Africa, and Asia is more cautious, with concern about pesticides and possible harm to health. 
Despite such opposition, GM 
technology is still being developed. It is thought that 670,000 children die from lack of vitamin A each year, a deficiency that causes diseases such as malaria and measles and leads to blindness. Advances in  the tackling of such deficiencies include, for example, the creation of “golden rice,” in which vitamin A  is added to ordinary rice. 
Disappearing farmland
While more—and stronger—crops were needed to feed an ever-growing global population, cities have swallowed up large tracts  of farmland and rural areas. At  GLOBAL POPULATION EXCEEDS 7 BILLION
the beginning of the 21st century, China experienced an onslaught  
of urban development that meant the loss of a large number of the country’s tiny farms. 
People have historically been 
drawn to cities for employment and social opportunities. In 1800, one  in four British people lived in cities, but by 1900 this had grown to three in four. Many moved from rural areas to the city, but people also moved from one country to another seeking refuge and a better life. The urban population in 2014 accounted for 54 percent of the total global population, up from 34 percent in 1960. In 2014, the  UN predicted that two-thirds of  the world will live in cities by  2050. However, lack of affordable accommodation is a key factor in homelessness: in sub-Saharan Africa, 70 percent of city-dwellers live in slums. Poor health and violent crime is an issue in the world’s major cities, as is the huge disparity between rich and poor.

standards without destroying the environment. Scientists believe that human activity is to blame  for climate change (or “global warming”). Since the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, global temperatures have continued to rise, with 2011–15 the warmest five-year period on record. 
Some of the reasons behind  
climate change are due to natural occurrences, but in the early 1970s the rise of environmentalism raised public doubts about the benefits  to the planet of human activity. Developing nations were being urged to reduce carbon emissions, which are thought to effect climate change. In 2015, India was opening a mine a month to lift its 1.3 billion citizens out of poverty rapidly. Developed countries, which had themselves contributed to climate change, caused a new tension by suggesting that developing nations should cease exploiting their own natural resources to improve the economic well-being of their people.Scientists warned that humans would pass the threshold beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible if greenhouse-gas emissions kept increasing. Sea levels are also  rising, eroding coastal areas and obliterating small islands in the South Pacific. Rainfall patterns are changing, leading to severe drought in Africa, and many species of animals are in danger of extinction. 
The threat of climate change is 
now considered so serious that leaders from around the world met in 2015 in Paris, France, at a conference to agree to reduce the build-up of greenhouse gases. In fraught negotiations, developing countries demanded that wealthier nations help pay for them to adapt to the effects of climate change, such as increased floods and droughts. In all, 196 nations adopted the first ever universal, legally binding, global climate deal, limiting global warming to the relatively safe level of 3.6°F (2°C).

IRISH INDEPENDENCE
(1922)
In the 1918 general election, 
republicans seeking independence from the United Kingdom won a majority of Irish seats. After the republicans set up their own parliament (the Dáil) and declared Ireland independent, Britain sent troops to quell the rebellion. By 1922, however, the two sides reached an agreement that most of Ireland should become independent as the Irish Free State, while the six northeastern counties, which had a Protestant majority, should remain part of the United Kingdom. This division is still in place to this day.
THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR
(1936–39)
In 1930–31, republicans overthrew Spain’s military dictatorship and forced King Alfonso XIII into exile. The republican government introduced socialist reforms and reduced the power of the church and the military. However, a revolt by disgruntled army officers and members of the Fascist Falange party led to civil war in 1936.  The conflict escalated into an international ideological clash,  with Fascist Italy and Germany supporting the right-wing Nationalists, while socialists from all over Europe volunteered to join their Republican comrades in Spain. Nationalist leader General Francisco Franco led his side to victory and ruled as dictator of Spain until 1975.DE GAULLE FOUNDS THE 
FRENCH FIFTH REPUBLIC
(1958)
In 1958, France faced a crisis  
over the future of its colony  Algeria—members of the French army opposed that country’s independence and were in open revolt against the Fourth Republic’s policies. The Republic collapsed, and retired military and political leader General Charles de Gaulle proposed a new government system with a strong executive president. This proposal won approval in a referendum, and de Gaulle himself was elected president. This Fifth Republic is still in place in France.
SUHARTO REPLACES 
SUKARNO IN INDONESIA
(1965–67)
In 1965 there was an attempted 
coup against Indonesia’s President Sukarno, but troops under Major-General Suharto, who had led Indonesia to independence in 1940, defeated the rebels. Communists were blamed for the coup, and Suharto, having seized power from Sukarno, had some 500,000 alleged communists killed. As Indonesia’s second president, Suharto ruled until 1998, leading the country into a period of economic development, with better health and living conditions for many. However,  his government was corrupt— he embezzled millions of dollars—and his invasion of East Timor resulted in a massive death toll.FURTHER EVENTS
WORLD WAR II IN  
THE PACIFIC
(1941–45)
In December 1941, the Japanese bombed the US fleet in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and launched a campaign of invasion in Thailand, Malaysia, Burma, the Philippines, and other targets. This action brought the US into World War II. US and Japanese forces were involved in years of bitter fighting, including a long air campaign; the largest ever naval battle at Leyte Gulf, Philippines (1944); a three-month land campaign to retake  the Philippines; the bloody 82-  
day battle of Okinawa; and the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945). 
THE FOUNDING OF THE 
UNITED NATIONS
(1944)
The United Nations was conceived 
during World War II as a way to bring the countries of the world together in order to prevent further devastating conflicts. Its aims were outlined at a 1944 conference at Dumbarton Oaks, Washington, DC, and it  
was formally established in 1945. Although the UN did not prevent subsequent wars, it has worked worldwide to promote peace and, through a range of special agencies and organizations, to champion education, health, human rights, independence for colonized peoples, and economic development. Most countries are now members.

THE MILITARY COUP  
IN BRAZIL
(1964)
The 1964 coup ousted Brazilian president João Goulart, whose social reforms were labeled “communist” by opponents. The coup, which was carried out by part of the army with US backing, ushered in a military government whose policies were  
in line with US views. There was a huge increase in foreign economic involvement in Brazil, and half of the country’s largest companies passed into foreign ownership. Brazil enjoyed high economic growth under the dictatorship, but at the expense of freedom, as opponents of the regime were treated harshly. 
THE RED ARMY FACTION’S 
TERRORIST ACTIVITY
(1970s)
In 1968, many western countries 
saw anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist demonstrations, strikes, and riots. These failed to produce any change, however, and in the aftermath, a number of groups evolved to pursue an armed anti-capitalist struggle. One of the most long-lasting of these groups was the Germany Red Army Faction, founded in 1970 and also known  as the Baader-Meinhof group, after two of its founders, Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof. The group carried out a series of terrorist attacks (including kidnappings, bombings, robberies, and murders), mostly in the 1970s but also in  later decades. Their activities—  
and those of similar groups such  as the Revolutionary Cells (also operating in Germany in the same period)—alienated most people.PINOCHET SEIZES POWER  
IN CHILE
(1973)
In 1973, a military coup led by General Augusto Pinochet deposed Chile’s elected socialist leader Salvador Allende, bringing Pinochet to power at the head of a military junta. The US opposed Allende’s left-wing government and backed the coup, because it considered its support for right-wing dictatorships in South America as part of its Cold War struggle against communism: socialist regimes were suppressed even if they were completely democratic. Pinochet, who was notorious for imprisoning, killing, and torturing his opponents, continued to receive American backing and ruled until 1990.
THE SOVIET INVASION  
OF AFGHANISTAN 
(1979)
In the late 1970s, Afghanistan’s  left-wing government (a close ally of the Soviet Union) was threatened by US-backed Muslim fighters, the mujahideen, who objected to the regime’s modernizing policies in areas such as women’s education. In 1979, the USSR invaded Afghanistan, beginning a 10-year war in which an estimated 1.5 million Afghans were killed and many others left the country. Groups of mujahideen guerrillas fought the invaders, who withdrew in 1989. The war left the USSR militarily and politically weakened, contributing to its collapse. A civil war then broke out between the mujahideen and the Afghan army, and power eventually passed to  the hardline Islamic Taliban.THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION
(1979)
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran, headed a secular regime that westernized the country and brought prosperity for some. In the late 1970s, an increasingly strong opposition movement gained prominence, led by Islamic leaders such as Ayatollah Khomeini, who preached against the country’s encroaching secular capitalism (as well as against communism). In 1979, the Shah was forced to leave the country, and Ayatollah Khomeini installed a new government that was focused on very strict Muslim values. The revolution had a huge impact, particularly in highlighting the increasing prominence of Islam on the world stage and in relations between the countries of the west and the Middle East. 
THE US AND BRITAIN

The 2003 invasion of Iraq started a war that saw forces, mainly from the US and Britain, deposing  the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, who oppressed his own people, supported international terrorism, and, according to the US and its allies, possessed weapons of mass destruction. Although the latter claim proved to be unfounded,  the removal of Saddam Hussein was nonetheless welcomed by many Iraqis. However, the lack  of a post-war strategy brought further instability and violence to Iraq, and the war gave extremist opponents of the US and their allies a pretext for launching terrorist attacks against them.
